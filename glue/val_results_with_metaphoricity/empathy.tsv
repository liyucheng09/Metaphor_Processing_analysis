Initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and attention this situation is creating. I myself on the one hand would sympathize with those who are in support of the flag, like putting myself in their shoes. In matters of free choice, if it is their choice to want to display the flag, I support their right of free choice. I am also in sympathy with those that may find offense of the Confederate Flag. It may in fact open up old wounds, and bring back hurtful memories. However I fully support our President's view. President and Mr. Donald Trump feels that the Confederate Flag should be placed in a museum. That course of action is an intelligent response, for both sides of the issue.

In fact, overdoses rose more than 100% over a 16-year period among all children, the study published in JAMA Pediatrics Oct. 31 showed. Researchers from Yale School of Medicine analyzed national data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database on children admitted to U.S. hospitals for opioid poisoning. The study focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012. What's to blame? Possibly the increase of prescribed pain killers, including OxyContin and Vicodin.

We usually think of human trafficking involving the kidnapping or sudden disappearance of a person. I just read about two pre-teen girls in Burma who were sent to work to help their family. Everything was legit at first, but as time progressed these poor girls, children really, were denied contact with their parents, tortured, and forced to work for no pay. My heart broke for them and for their parents. What’s even worse, the police ignored the parents’ request for intervention with no success.

First, why was there not a sign or caution tape to block off the broken elevator? How was the mother able to walk into it without knowing that it was broken? The other tenant's reports about the condition of the elevators in the past are also alarming. Why was this problem not addressed long ago by the landlord? It should not take such a horrible event to occur for people to recognize that there is a problem with the building and the way technicians are doing inspections.	<s> There are several strange factors <m>surrounding</m> the tragic and fatal event.

I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	<s> The thought of such conditions <m>in</m> the slaughtering of chickens is very disturbing.
