I just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens, but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up, I don't know if we can really take her seriously and that's really sad.

It's bad enough because it is just a natural disaster situation, but the fact that there was also mismanagement involved is particularly troubling.  The government failed to properly care for the canals.  The article also speaks of selling off many of its wild animals.  This might become a very serious problem given the fact that some of the animals are endangered species such as the wild dog.  They are also looking at selling off elephants, lions and pythons.

It basically says that humans have destroyed 10 percent of Earth's wilderness in the last 25 years.  The article said that the total land area is about half the size of the Amazon and twice the size of the whole state of Alaska.  That is about 1.3 million square miles of wilderness, that just disappeared.  The article also revealed that humanity has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too late.

I am by no means a vegetarian, and enjoy eating chicken a great deal. However, the thought of torturing a chicken for slaughter turns my stomach. There needs to be an ethical solution to the slaughtering of all animals, not just chicken. And I believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal, but most likely not cost efficient.	0.05555555555555555	<s> The thought of such conditions <m><m>in</m> the</m> slaughtering of chickens is very disturbing.

My heart goes out to the person who worked hard to try to save its life and is grieving over the loss of that hard battle. As a wildlife rehabilitator I know the struggle all too well. I understand how it feels to forgo sleep and food because you are working to save an animal. It is painful. But if you can save even one, it will make it all worth it in the end.	0.13513513513513514	<s> It saddens me to think <m><m>about</m> a</m> young rino passing away.

There has been so many instances of men prevailing in their sport that it is now time that women do the same. Sports have been men's things for so long and I am happy to see that there are women joining the ranks of these top athletes. I am so proud of my species and how we have come so far in equality. I love that there are more even playing grounds now.	0.1348314606741573	<s> <m><m>These</m> days,</m> women are winning <m><m>in</m> sports.</m> There has been so many instances of men prevailing <m><m>in</m> their</m> sport that it is now time that women do the same.
