Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics remain the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always [added] to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life . The clergy were and still are in a special position , holding power over the laity because of it .	70

Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot . As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear , he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense , one who was concerned for public life , and believed ( like activists of the Left ) that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ; whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's political pronouncements , even when he was most engag as editor of True Criterion , revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .	76

Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology , at best to be read only in historical terms , or subject to symptomatic readings , seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced . Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit [images] and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature . Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .	127

If anything , the return of the land to the practising farmers by the land Acts would have strengthened such a morality . It is also interesting to [note] that the issue of land inheritance was a key reason why the Irish population voted no in the referendum on divorce in 1986 .

Much of this is due to the face that , following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership , many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits . At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ; yet during 1988 alone , Claire Hunt has [noted] , Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .

We must approach observations of linguistic behaviour with the same careful attitude as we approach other kinds of behaviour or indeed as we approach our electrophysiological observations . It is also worth [noting] that correlations between ERPs and behaviour are never perfect , perhaps because of masking of some of the ERPs by random fluctuations of the background EEG .

For example , hunters and gatherers were placed low while irrigating cultivators were placed high , then these activities were linked directly with such institutions as rules concerning property , the status of women , the type of government , and the kinship system . In this , Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just [noted] . However , Ancient Society also differed from earlier work because of the high quality of the scholarly work on which it was based , because of the sympathy of the writer for primitives , and because it not only defined stages but in many cases suggested mechanisms which explained why one stage should change to another . This last element , perhaps more than any other , is crucial for understanding why Marx and Engels attached so much more importance to the work of Morgan than they did to the work of the other evolutionist anthropologists whom they read .	72

There was another political task to which anthropology was put in the work of Marx , and for this the writings of Morgan also proved particularly appropriate . The use of anthropology which we have already [noted] can be called historical . Marx and Engels were interested in primitive cultures because they wanted to construct a general history and theory of society in order to explain the coming to be of capitalism . The second way in which they use anthropological material we can call rhetorical .	52

This was because according to Morgan kin terms lag behind . As a result , the evidence for this second stage in the history of marriage depends entirely on the two assumptions which we have already [noted] . One that patterns of kin terms indicate types of marriage , and second , that the presence of such a pattern is a guide to a previous state of affairs . The Polynesians , according to this way of seeing things , had a system of kinship terms , which indicated , not the marriage system which they practised , but the marriage system which they had practised in the past .	69

According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes , and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses . This is a crucial proposition which we have already [noted] and which will be discussed again later in this book . It is by means of this idea that the State is linked with the earlier part of the origin of kinship and marriage .

In other words , a declaration of common ownership of the land of the gens does not imply free and equal access to all within the gens . Marx , in particular , had already [noted] this fact in several places , but he explained the phenomenon of internal division as a transitional one ; as evidence of a stage in which private property and individual families were coming in and undermining the communal descent group . A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence . In any case , the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .	67

Among living hunters and gatherers , women may have a comparatively high status as amongst the Mbuti of Africa , or a comparatively low status among most Australian Aborigines The issue is far more complicated and it is only fair to [note] that we have not reached a stage of knowledge when we can easily say what explains the status of women among the different peoples of the world . The status of women has several aspects which themselves do not go simple together .

It is interesting to [note] that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them . Where land was readily acquired so that the farmstead could be enlarged in a logical way , rather than the haphazard development which resulted from the erection of buildings on whatever sites became available , individual buildings within the grouping were sited so as to maximise efficiency . Threshed straw had to be taken from the barns to the cattle or the horses for use as feed or litter .	84

If anything , the return of the land to the practising farmers by the land Acts would have strengthened such a morality . It is also interesting to [note] that the issue of land inheritance was a key reason why the Irish population voted no in the referendum on divorce in 1986 .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill was going through parliament , the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority , without qualification , is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family , the Church in education , the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions ( Irish Independent , 12 Apr. 1951 , quoted Whyte 1980 : 143 ) .

Quite clearly , as costs were four times direct revenue , 10 per cent ( for example ) saving in costs had much more effect on the balance than did a potential 20 per cent increase in revenue , so energy was at first concentrated on the cost base .
