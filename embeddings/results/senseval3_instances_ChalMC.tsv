At a neurophysiological level , the intensity of an experience is typically reflected in the number of neurones [activated] ( the phenomenon of recruitment ) and , more specifically , in the firing frequency of the relevant neurones . Extensity ( for example the size of a patch of light ) usually correlates with the number and spatial distribution of receptors activated . Finally , duration is correlated with the period of time for which the relevant neurones are active .	51

When I learnt biology , I was taught that Weismann , although he was right about the independence of germ line and soma , had given the wrong answer to this question . He argued that cells become different because , at the time of cell division , different genes are transmitted to different daughter cells ( he did not use the word gene , but that is what he meant ) ; whereas in fact all body cells contain the same genes , and become different because different genes are [activated] in different cells . Now it is true that Weismann was mistaken in thinking that different cells receive different genes , but his reasons for thinking so are illuminating . He saw that the alternative was to suppose that cells become different because they are exposed to different external influences .	97

Another example illustrating the importance of cytoplasmic factors in continually controlling gene activity comes from fusing mature muscle cells with cells of a completely different type . Mature striated muscle cells make muscle - specific proteins and when such a cell is fused with a variety of other cell types which include liver and cartilage cells , then muscle - specific genes are [activated] in these cells leading to the production of muscle - specific proteins . Identification of the new muscle proteins was made possible by fusing human cells with mouse muscle cells ; the human muscle proteins are similar but distinct from those made by mice . There can be no doubt , from these experiments , of the importance of factors in the cytoplasm controlling gene action .	83

The signal for the collapse of the regime was Mr Najibullah 's announcement last month that he was ready to step down in favour of a United Nations - appointed interim committee . It destroyed morale throughout the regime , forcing commanders and party chiefs to [activate] their tribal links with the Mujahideen and save their skins before the time of reckoning . The effect has been to accentuate divisions between the majority Pushtuns ( known in the days of the Raj as Pathans ) and the ethnic minorities of the north such as the Tajiks , who are kin to the people of the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan across the Amu Darya river . The minorities have thrown off the Pashtun yoke , largely thanks to the military prowess of Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud , a Tajik from the Jamiat - e - Islami ( Islamic Society ) opposition group .	88

The cyclotron needs a magnetic field and a transverse AC electric field to pump energy into ions in motion in that field . There are ions [activated] by thermal motion in blood and these are always subject to the Earth 's magnetic field . Proximity to a weak 50Hz or 60Hz electric field therefore means that ions in a certain mass range can respond to cyclotron action .

Their proposal ( see Chapter 3 ) was that the associability of an element [activated] by external stimulation will be enhanced when this element lacks associative connections . The analysis offered by interference theory is similar , but rather simpler it is that the existence of these ( within stimulus ) associations will interfere with the ability of the elements to form new ones .

The MiniLink and MaxiLink container systems , both of which [appeared] in 1987 , incorporated some novel design features which enabled road - rail transfer without the need for separate lifting equipment . An even more exciting development was TrailerTrain , comprising a specially profiled road trailer which could be loaded on to railway bogies , again without the need for fixed equipment at the transfer location . Finally , one of the best kept secrets of the decade until its unveiling in 1988 was the Redland self - discharge aggregates train , a permanently coupled set of hopper wagons with a conveyor belt running underneath and a special unloading vehicle at one end .	93

The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov , writing the very year Crime and Punishment appeared in hard covers , who observes that Raskolnikov 's mental torment , which is his punishment in all but its public aspect , begins with his first promptings towards the crime .

Her last film RATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN ( 1964 ) whose commercial and critical failure ended her career , can be seen as a woman 's reply to the eulogies of the working class male celebrated by John Osbourne and his like , and it does so by poking fun at the ideology of the male and his crude sexism .	94

But again Dostoevsky is fumbling after a creative or regenerative suffering , because it is of the essence of Raskolnikov 's questions , desires , feelings , and so forth ( which of course do [appear] in the novel ) that they should be agonized . The fictional morphology of this suffering is more aptly suggested by the novelist and critic Akhsharumov , writing the very year Crime and Punishment appeared in hard covers , who observes that Raskolnikov 's mental torment , which is his punishment in all but its public aspect , begins with his first promptings towards the crime . Thus Akhsharumov directs the reader to something that makes him certain he holds a masterpiece in his hands before he has read half a dozen pages : a single pre - natal life , a foetal stirring and growth , no ordinary robust narrative sense of something afoot .	86

The principal one was that conversion and growth were particularly directed at the clerical - religious lite , where the annual retreat system formed the annual or biennial centre of the individual spiritual life . The retreat consisted , and still does , of anything from five to thirty days of spiritual exercises , usually in an [atmosphere] of silence and contemplation apart from listening to the preacher when there is one , but with additional features of both vocal and silent prayer . The laity had a pale reflection of this programme in the parish mission , designed to convert the laity or at least bring them back to regular church practices . Morality was for the laity , whose life was dominated by the battle against mortal sin , and who therefore lived under the threat of hell and were always at risk .	88

The Victorian and Edwardian eras witnessed many wholesale rebuildings of modest Georgian drinking - houses ; during the Interwar period even more money was pumped into enlarging and rebuilding old pubs , as well as in creating large new ones ( see Alan Powers ' essay below ) . However , alterations were more often than not effected with some degree of sympathy for the existing fabric and [atmosphere] . With the advent of postwar Modernism much of this sympathy evaporated . The ascetic modernists ' rejection of history in order to create a visionary brave New World was clearly incompatible with the historic pub .	80

In October of that year the AR regretted that nearly all competition entries had evaded the key problem and had signally failed to achieve the genuine pub atmosphere . Contemporary design , the magazine 's editor regretted , because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not appear immediately familiar , whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent no matter how misguided in themselves have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional [atmosphere] . As pub designer Tim May noted in his address to CAMRA 's AGM of 1990 : By any objective standards , the competition was a disaster . The response of the 1960s and 70s to this failure to capture the essence of the traditional pub was the ruthlessly - applied corporate image and the proliferation of fun theme - pubs .	115

A traditional interior does not have to be incompatible with accommodating whole families , nor with providing meals ; yet an increasing number of old pub interiors are being sacrificed on the altar of the identikit eating house whether the brewer 's concept be a downmarket steakhouse or part of a family restaurant chain masquerading as an independent local concern . Many of the interiors created by the designers of such facilities are as forbidding as the old - fashioned spit - and - sawdust pub ; any lingering [atmosphere] is swept away in a barrage of stained wood and fake Victoriana , and any casual visitors made to feel inordinately guilty if they do not , alas , wish to eat . The subjugation of individual character in such cases which on occasion even involves the removal of all traces of the pub 's actual name is particularly depressing . The aim of this report is not to demand that brewers turn the block back to 1620 , 1720 , 1820 or even to 1920 ; pubs have to make money , and have to adapt to some extent to changing needs and expectations .	107

Filmmakers were constricted as to subject matter by the requirement that their films contribute in some way to the war effort . That was the deal to keep British filmmakers in business which Alexander Korda had proposed to government , and supported with his propaganda film , The Lion Has Wings ( 1939 ) , combining documentary footage with patriotic clips from earlier feature films and a contemporary narrative full of pontifications on Britain 's purpose in going to war .	104

The hills themselves looked asleep , the heather glowed dust - blue in the hazy light , and the people , after a night of little sleep and hours of walking and standing , now looked stunned as they sat on the grassy banks , leaned on dykes , or lay on their backs in the hayfields , munching oatcakes and drinking the last of their water .

In some cases it also helped to underline the main moments in the action by emphasising gestures for greater strength and expression . In other cases they added humour , most notably in Lanchbery 's score for La Fille Mal Garde , where several witty slants in the orchestration raise laughter , for example the music for the Cock and the Hens .	77

So the choreographer cannot make strong contrasts between the style usually used for the other - worldly spirits and that used for the characters living in the particular setting . He can only highlight the [atmosphere] supporting the plot , especially those circumstances where he has to portray differences between classes and thus general behaviour , idiosyncrasies , etc. , for example the contrast that must be made between the dances for all and sundry in the town square and those for the aristocrats in the ballroom of Romeo and Juliet . Nevertheless every choreographer creating this kind of romantic ballet today has to spend much time creating the proper gestures to replace the words , which in such ballets are never spoken but must be understood . If the dancers perform those gestures with feeling and understanding they will express the moods , emotions and actions of the characters they play .	59

As already noted , the dances Fokine staged for the nursemaids , coachmen and others at the Fair were real dances ( see page 59 ) . They created the [atmosphere] and mood , but the narrative was told by the dolls using specially created movements which could be called dances of character . Characters from the commedia dell'arte When Dauberval defined what he meant by dances of character he undoubtedly had in mind some easily recognised characters of the commedia dell'arte , whose actors regularly played such roles as the absent - minded doctor or scientist , miser , termagant wife or widow and various clowns such as the sad Pierrot or zany clown .	66

Even though the boys and girls are figments of Robbins ' imagination , their brief encounter is based in reality even to the introduction of popular dance steps and stylistic elements current during the 193945 war . Both the above - mentioned works show that ballets based on the life of real people require that choreographers closely observe the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of all types of person and that they make them recognisable in order that they convey meaning .	32

If the launch seems slow , check the speed every few seconds . Reducing the [climbing] angle slightly will help the driver to recognise the need for more speed . However , levelling out too much will cause a large amount of slack in the cable and a further loss of speed , often leaving the aircraft in a dangerously nose - high attitude with no pull from the cable to maintain the speed .

However , levelling out too much will cause a large amount of slack in the cable and a further loss of speed , often leaving the aircraft in a dangerously nose - high attitude with no pull from the cable to maintain the speed . With a slow launch the pilot must decide if the speed is sufficient to continue [climbing] . If it is , he should hold the present attitude and stand by to lower the nose if the speed drops any further . If the launch is much too slow , the nose must be lowered and the launch abandoned immediately .	77

In this position , the glider is on a base leg for any available field upwind and it is easy to look back and decide whether returning to the field is practical . On a normal tow , except for very low performance machines , the [climbing] angle of the towplane and glider is much steeper than the glider 's gliding angle when flying downwind . So , in theory , the glider should be within easy reach of the gliding site . However , in turbulent and windy conditions it is always better to play safe and land into wind in another field , rather than to make a downwind landing .	86
climb.v	770001	to move upward; go towards the top; ascend.	literal	_	It is possible that this has contributed to the risk of the glider zooming too high just after take off . In windy weather , the effects of the wind gradient near the ground accentuate any movement up or down of the towplane and glider . If the towplane gains speed by flying close to the ground , when it noses up to start [climbing] , the effect of the wind gradient accentuates the climb so that the glider may easily be left flying close to the ground , in or near the wake and below the tug . Then , when the glider pilot recognises he is far too low , any quick movement to regain position takes the glider up through the same wind gradient , causing a sudden surge of speed and producing an unexpected and possibly uncontrollable gain of height . At the same time , the extra load in the tow rope accentuates the nose - up pitching movement on the glider ( as in a winch launch ) .	64

The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect . Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere [images] .

Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology , at best to be read only in historical terms , or subject to symptomatic readings , seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced . Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit [images] and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature . Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .	127

Much of this is due to the face that , following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership , many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits . At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ; yet during 1988 alone , Claire Hunt has [noted] , Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses .

This depleted the famine areas further , and sparked off new hatred amongst the peasants .

There were factors at play in the association of theatrical cross - dressing and sexual transgressions . Not only did prostitutes frequent the theatre , but the street transvestite was sometimes associated with prostitution and possibly sodomy : Henriques [notes] a regulation dating from 1480 forbidding prostitutes to dress as men in public , and remarks : This masquerading presumably would have meant an added inducement to sodomy ( Prostitution and Society , ii . 88 ) .

This is a crucial proposition which we have already [noted] and which will be discussed again later in this book .

Marx , in particular , had already [noted] this fact in several places , but he explained the phenomenon of internal division as a transitional one ; as evidence of a stage in which private property and individual families were coming in and undermining the communal descent group . A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence .

Where these is no need for a retained iron structure to accept enlarged loads and it is apparent that the metal members are in food condition , not having been subjected to detrimental modifications , the chief consideration in re - using the installation is to achieve an acceptable standard of fire resistance .	42

The [performance] of modern gliders makes it much easier and more likely for a pilot to fly himself into a potential death trap unless he uses his imagination or has already learned to have a healthy respect for the elements . The result has been a noticeable increase in the number of pilots who suddenly find themselves faced with a situation far beyond their control , usually a situation that they had not even considered at the start of the flight .

He says that it is a sad fact that many early RDS receivers failed to perform even basic tasks adequately , and many people have been put off RDS for life because of : experiences with receivers that performed inadequately and which failed to live up to the promises the broadcasters made for them . Mr Saunders goes on to admit that broadcasters are not entirely blameless in this respect : More should no doubt have been done at an earlier stage in development of RDS to give the receiver manufacturing industry some guidelines setting out the minimum levels of RDS [performance] that should be achieved . His belief is that it is preferable if the RF tuner and RDS processing stages of the receiver are continuously active whenever the vehicle ignition is switched on . The on/off switch on the front panel should only control the power amplifiers and display functions .	137

A general view There is a third type of choreographer who [produces] ballets which give audiences great pleasure through the sheer variety of their virtuoso designs . Because of the interesting , usually technical , demands made on the performers , their ballets often become testing grounds for future soloists . Variations from such ballets as Petipa 's Don Quixote , Raymonda and La Bayadre and Bournonville 's Napoli are still considered by most classical dancers to be more technically demanding than the more complex twistings and turnings of modern choreographers who mix their styles .	53

'The artist couldn't produce without encouragement'.	metaphorical	0.3333333333333333	Today there are many ballets which are created in the generally accepted styles from which choreographers can borrow : classical , demi - caractre , romantic , character and/or national , and modern ( see pages 75138 ) . However , when necessary , choreographers can and should create a particular style that is perhaps based on a mixture of the above but that is , in the final analysis , a style suitable for one ballet only . Such choreographers as Ashton , MacMillan and Robbins have [produced] some ballets which have an exclusive style of their own . The most outstanding are possibly Monotones , Gloria and Afternoon of a Faun . Although the movements in all three are classically based , they would look out of place in older classical ballets or danced to other music .	88

The history of forms in art has had some distinguished advocates , some of whom have been concerned with the transformation over time of one form to another ; others have been more attracted to problems of values , arguing either that styles in art change and decay , or that in a particular period there is an artistic will to [produce] work in a style of its own . These are matters which border on philosophy . Eternal values can also be sought in art , as they were by the French art historian Eacute ; lie Faure , whose open mind accepted disparate arts , a view which he expressed like this : It is not paradoxical at all to affirm that an Ivory Coast mask and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel express the same need to manifest a harmonious rapport which exists between mankind and the universe .	104

As a Greek and Latin scholar he had found them described in the works of ancient authors who wrote about the moods , emotions and actions of all the actors involved in their dramas . By 1717 these gestures were accepted practice by actors to reinforce the meaning of the words spoken and particularly by members of the commedia dell'arte travelling troupes who [produced] mime plays . In these the expert gestures and extemporised playing of easily recognised characters in certain stock situations were understood by audiences everywhere no matter what the native language because the gestures were so explicit .
