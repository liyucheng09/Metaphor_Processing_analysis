Recent information from former detainees , lawyers and human rights activists indicates that suspected political opponents of the government , including boys under 18 , have been detained in garde vue well beyond the maximum 10 - day period and without obtaining further authorization after four days as required by Tunisian law. AI is concerned that the Tunisian Government , by its failure to investigate allegations of torture brought to its notice , [appears] to be condoning the use of torture . AI welcomed the formation by the Tunisian Government of an official human rights council on 9 April 1991 , although the organization remained concerned at continuing reports of torture and ill - treatment of political detainees in garde vue detention .

If you have had your letters to Dr Nguyen Dan Que from Vietnam returned , could you please send them to Dr Que 's brother , Dr Nguyen Quoc - Quan , . From the letters we have been receiving this year it [appears] that the Jehovah 's Witness from Greece Andreas Christodoulou has been passing some of the cards on to his colleagues who are also imprisoned Jehovah 's witnesses , who want to correspond with people in the U.K. Fortunately we have someone in the office who has been able to translate their letters . Please continue to write until all the prisoners of conscience in the series are free , or until there have been satisfactory investigations into those who have disappeared . Artists for Rochdale	73

Recently , an anonymous note , clearly composed from a dialogue between a prisoner and a sympathetic guard , was smuggled out . It described where the prisoners were held : ; the people of Tazmamert [appear] to be hardly aware of it or too frightened to talk about it . It is said that the prison director steals the fuel to warm his own house in Meknes . The note describes the walk downstairs to visit the cells .	62

How to find the money necessary to carry out Amnesty 's work has always been a worry , and from the very beginning the Section Office asked groups for help in this area . However , in the first few years groups did not [appear] to consider fundraising a priority . A newsletter in 1964 complains that it is clear that the requested 10 per annum is more than one group can manage . It is extraordinary to consider that nowadays groups manage a contribution of 600 per annum !	78

Fletcher in a catalogue for an exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden , Washington , in 1988 . Writing about a small bust on a column , a thin sculpture in a series of four busts of which the others were fuller in form , she comments that the extremely thin proportions of the head contrast with the solidity of the base . So delicately modulated are the forms of the head that the human element [appears] ephemeral . This tenuous fragility contrasts with the three later busts on a stele , which have substantial anatomical forms . The sculptor had decided that he wanted this bust to confront the observer .	93
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	I raised the head on a base until the eye is at eye level . You see an eye . This intention differed from the sculptor 's frequent artistic aim to make his small figures [appear] remote . The catalogue has the additional interest of a memoir by Silvio Berthoud , who had sat as a boy between five and eight for his uncle : I have very unpleasant recollections of sitting for him , for it was of utmost importance not to move but to fix him right in the eye and listen to him complain , saying as he always did that he was getting nowhere .	35
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	These examples of catalogues containing helpful art criticism could be contrasted with many others which are limited to lists of exhibitions , details of the artist 's career , and entries for the works displayed . There are other hazards for the readers of catalogues . Some publications are less impartial than they might [appear] , erring on the side of generosity . Museums with exhibitions of art from other countries are especially likely to be respectful in commentaries on works of art which have been borrowed . All the same , museum curators will have carried out a critical task in selecting the exhibition , in some instances having fended off proposals for inclusions with a political or a particular cultural bias .	54

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Together with its stultifying racial enmities , this seems to have brought it to a halt , and placed it beyond history . The behaviour of Naipaul 's hustler - hero , his greedy white woman , his pseudo - guerrillas and mysterious gangs , his grafting emergent politicians with their State of Emergency , can be divided into the phantasmagorical and the political . But these dimensions , as I have said , often [appear] to coincide . His leading characters are seen to be , in some sense , petty and peripheral : but peripheral to what ? To standards of conduct attained in other countries , metropolitan standards , or to something on the island ?	75

Either book could be considered the masterpiece of someone whom I think of as among the most gifted authors now at work in England . It might [appear] that the whole life of the later novel is in its sting , but there is more to it than sting . Conrad said of The Secret Agent , another book about revolutionaries , cranks , crooks , somnambulists , peripherals and phantasmagoricals , that it was written in scorn as well as in pity , and the same could be said of Guerrillas . But in passing , as they may be thought to have done , from journalism to fiction , Naipaul 's feelings , and their objects , underwent a change .	50

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Its narrator and chief human presence is by no means straightforwardly a victim , and the difference between oppressor and oppressed can be hard to identify . The novel is narrated by a Moslem of Indian origin , whose family has been settled on the east coast of Africa , as traders . Salim leaves them , takes off on the first of a series of flights , and treks to the interior , to a country which [appears] to be compounded of the Congo and of Uganda , in order to earn a living from a store which he has acquired from a man whose daughter he is expected to marry one day . Reading Salim 's palm , the man points out that he is faithful . Salim can be designated a Kenya Asian : the name we give to those hard - working aliens who have been driven out of African countries , and who include the shopkeepers and merchants expropriated in Uganda by Amin .	78

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The affair seems to him to belong to the town , to have no future , and they are parted when the town comes under fear and hazard . He finds himself considering the idea of flight , and the idea of defeat : 1 suppose that , thinking of my own harassment and Raymond 's defeat , I had begun to consider Yvette a defeated person as well , trapped in the town , as sick of herself and the wasting asset of her body as I was sick of myself and my anxieties . But the fit of jealousy in which he beats her would [appear] to mean something more than these words of explanation enable one to understand . This jealousy may be felt to be like Othello 's in having more to do with difference of race , and with the jealousies of race , than the jealous man , or than the work he belongs to , seems disposed to state . Three of literature 's myths underlie the narrative .	107

Ronald Fraser was not trying to determine , like certain historians of former times , what his past really was . But there is some question of a pathogenic secret , of the recovery of material hitherto repressed which influenced his perception of his mother : and his understanding of the past would certainly [appear] to have been enlarged by his researches . He talks of himself as split , and as implicated in splits of a wider incidence . A split appears to be spoken of in the conversation from which I have just quoted : formed by the past , he is also deformed by it .	66

A split [appears] to be spoken of in the conversation from which I have just quoted : formed by the past , he is also deformed by it . But this is only one aspect of the bifurcation he describes . Fraser 's fork took several forms , as I say : or one might prefer to say that there was more than one fork to reckon with .	61

But being consoled by another mother who seems unfrustrating makes it harder to reconcile the two . This [appears] to be a key point , but it is one that is left controversial . It is possible to imagine that for some people such consolation might make it easier to reconcile the two , and to wonder what it was that made the difference in Fraser 's case . There were other things that had to be reconciled , and we hear presently of a role of inherent superiority which came to me from outside , from the servants among others .	33

Nor was he able to believe in the religion of his community . Anti - Semitism was not , it [appears] , a major threat in an environment where many kinds of threat and affliction such as its gangster debt - collectors , the menodge men competed for consciousness . His mother died early , worn out by making ends meet and by her husband 's gambling . Glasser still stands in awe of this formidable , feckless man.	54

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	But it can scarcely be in doubt that these books have in them home truths , and an ironic obliquity or duplicity , which richly relate to the world of Jaruzelski 's predecessors , and indeed to the experience of other countries where literature and opinion have been repressed . Their writing coincided with the rise of Solidarity . They are books which bring together all three of the worlds we inhabit , and they are books which [appear] to thrive on being seen through on the transparency of their suggestion that tyrannies , that sycophancy , conspiracy and repression , courts and courtiers , are all on the royal right , and in the bush , and running into the sand . Heroine of Our Time SUICIDE was thought damnable in the Middle Ages , and I expect there are those who have been brought to feel by a book called The Monument that the Middle Ages had a point .	78

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Literary careers can be founded on the impersonation and adulation of privileged behaviour ; but the literary works which have been written and inspired by English snobs and sports are by no means all boastful or complicit . The supreme text of recent years is James Fox 's account of Lord Lucan and his set , with their boffes de politesse . Patrician insolence has quite often [appeared] to express a perception of the activities of the levelling Labour governments which have come and gone since 1945 . Behrens 's book , however , pays no attention to politics or to public matters . His story begins at a time when , as at other times in this century , the patriciate , and the merely rich , had slipped down into marked collusion with the smart , with upstarts and bohemians .	67
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Here and elsewhere , the method , for all that Amis would hate to hear it , is dialectical . In the novels I am thinking of he attributes certain ideas to certain characters and utters them in the prevailing manner of the novel , while also submitting them to question within it . He can [appear] in so doing to have his opinions and to eat them too . And he can also appear to place the novel in a state of suspension . If the state was not present in his novels from the first , it is there in One Fat Englishman , and in Jake 's Thing .	56

If the state was not present in his novels from the first , it is there in One Fat Englishman , and in Jake 's Thing . It is there in Stanley and the Women , which persuaded Marilyn Butler somewhat against the odds , but none the less intelligibly to interpret it in the London Review as a critique of male supremacy , but which has left a very different impression on others .	54
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	And there are , in fact , several barriers in his writings : that between Jenny and the Reds could be considered another . In all this sharp distinguishing , in all this enemy thing that Amis has , there are elements of anxiety , and of misrepresentation . Many of the actions performed by many women , according to the misogynists he likes to write about , are performed by many men , and many ugly people would [appear] to be just as happy , and just as emotionally fulfilled , as many lovely ones . Amis also likes to write , as Larkin liked to write , about the fear of death , and it may be that this fear can be detected in the failure to notice here that both sorts of people are subject to it , as to other unavoidable misfortunes , and that both sorts die . Amis and Larkin are the same but different .	79
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	True art , or the best art , has a dialogic structure , many voices , and so has the good society . This is an author who has contributed to the Russia which has come after him to the emergence there , at the present time , of the demand for a lawful Opposition , for the duality of democracy . The difference yields a political meaning , in other words , and it would also [appear] to relate to the old theory of the difference between an author who tells and an author who shows , and who employs a medley of voices in order to do so . It is a distinction which may in the end prove more suggestive than serviceable : the author who tells , and who can be accounted something of a ventriloquist , may well , for instance , be more than capable of carnival , and may even be every bit as plural in his works as his dialogic counterpart . But it is possible to believe that the idea of ventriloquism which lies at the heart of it may be successfully applied both to some sorts of contemporary author and to some of what went before .	77
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	At the same time , he accepts the obvious fact that facts are never just coming at you but are incorporated by an imagination that is formed by your previous experience . At the end of the book , though , Zuckerman confronts Roth with the opinion that the latter has made a mistake in trying to tame or to shed his imagination in the foregoing text , that fiction is superior to fact , and that the factuality of The Facts is specious . Roth would [appear] to believe both the claim and the counter - claim as to the value of the text , and to believe , too , both that the Roth part of the book does not represent an exercise of the imagination and that it does . It seems reasonable to think that The Facts is imagined , and that it could promote a benevolent view of the literal or faithful as opposed to the fantastically transgressive imagination , which may or may not , in any given case , be directly concerned with the facts of the author 's own life . It is a work which might well shed a tender light on the novella Goodbye , Columbus .	87
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The Facts is able to treat the historical conditioning of Portnoy 's Complaint in a way in which the novel itself was not in a position to do . It has the benefit of hindsight . But it would also [appear] to know its own place in history in a way which an exercise of the furious imagination in art can sometimes seem to prevent . Different genres , different imaginations . Roth has left off with his mythologising fury and his memoir lets us know that the benefits that come to the writer who tries , or even seems , to stick to the facts may amount to something more than those of hindsight .	40
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Zuckerman tells his Maria : Being Zuckerman is one long performance and the very opposite of what is thought of as being oneself . In fact , those who most seem to be themselves [appear] to me people impersonating what they think they might like to be , believe they ought to be , or wish to be taken to be by whoever is setting standards . So in earnest are they that they do n't even recognise that being in earnest is the act . For certain self - aware people , however , this is not possible : to imagine themselves being themselves , living their own real , authentic , or genuine life , has for them all the aspects of a hallucination .	34

This is reminiscent of the sort of inversion a fault - finding literary criticism can produce which is not to deny , which is indeed to admit , that the Arab leaders and polemicists of the region have had their faults , including some of those which have been identified over the years by Commentary . The magazine 's line on such matters would also [appear] to be remote from , and distinctly harder than , that taken in its dying days by the Reagan Administration . George Schultz travelled to the Middle East in the summer of 1988 to spread the word that the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead - end street . The belief that this can continue is an illusion .	91
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Let us praise , more than we do , and as we can here , the literal writer . But there is no doing so unless we accept that the literal writer has an imagination . Levi can sometimes [appear] incapable of fiction , but it is no less apparent that everything he wrote was fiction . He was well - aware of the sense in which he made up what happened to him , imagined his misfortune . In calling his recent book about his own early life by the name of The Facts , Philip Roth is issuing a challenge expecting his readers to know that there are no bare facts , and obliging them to think hard about what happens in the recounting of the facts of a life .	39

His religion is as much as anything the regression to a past of obedience , disobedience , sin and doom . Such things are celebrated in his stories with a richness and unction which might [appear] to make a renegade of Babel and certainly of Levi . Singer 's religion is also a feeling for the power of the community to censure and reject . This power is apparent in the story of his sorcerer .	45
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	This , as he recognises , is a form of self - praise . Throughout , Patrick is both the King of the World that he wants to be Glasgow belongs to him and an abject sinner . The rage of the novel 's males can sometimes be made to [appear] the rage of those who believe themselves permanently beaten and cheated . The women are the vessels of a better spirit ; the injury to them is greater , and it is their own men who are responsible for some of that injury . Patrick rages and scorns in proportion to his frustration : Hamlet 's weakness has its counterpart here .	50

The shortest stories in Greyhound for Breakfast owe a lot to Kafka 's briefer parables , though they are apt to be more difficult to understand ; and there can be no doubt that Beckett 's solipsistic tramps have left an impression on the earlier writings . These influences , however , would [appear] to have receded , or to have been digested . The speech of Glasgow people is the big thing in the novel . This is a good Scots which is at once distinctly literary and faithful to the speech of the city .	75

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Over the same period , the Church of Ireland experienced continuing rounds of church closures and became top - heavy in numbers of clergy . Statistics up to 1971 showed it as having an old - age structure and to have been in continuing decline , though there are recent signs of improvement ( Census of Ireland 1981 ) . Southern protestants do not [appear] to be particularly oppressed by the state ( White 1975 : 169 ) , but they would clearly change aspects of the constitution and legislation if they were in a position to do so . They have always retained a low political profile . They have also never been perceived by the state as a threat , perhaps because of the revolutionary pedigree of some of their lite .	64
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The majority of the Roman catholic remnant in the North still believe in a united Ireland . They demonstrate this partially by their support for the two nationalist parties , Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party , though support for the latter does not necessarily imply nationalism . Despite the official socialist tendencies of these two parties , a substantial number of their voters do not [appear] to question the maintenance of a capitalist - type class structure in a new Ireland . The Workers ' Party still fails to command many votes in elections north or south of the border . The provisional movement is divided on the issue of capitalism but , for the time at least , has an openly declared policy of achieving an island - wide socialist republic by the combined means of violence and the democratic process .	69
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The occasional independent unionist and independent Orange - lodge representative in politics were a feature of politics from 1880 to 1972 . The Northern Ireland Labour Party also was the principal organization representing protestant trade unionists . But none of these groupings ever came near to threatening the dominance of Unionist Party organization , much less the solidarity of protestant loyalists , which always [appeared] total on the issue of incorporation into a united , independent Ireland . It was only with the Troubles , from 1968 , that unionists broke ranks . Yet , despite the splintering , they have succeeded in allying the present two main parties against the Anglo - Irish agreement of 1985 .	64
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	It is clear that in the past many of them have considered loyalty to be a two - way process , a contract or covenant , and that the state could be a traitorous party as well as the people . The tradition proved of crucial importance in forming the basis for the strategy of the alliance from 1911 until British recognition of their separate political claim in 1914 . If the tradition still exists today and it [appears] that it very much does so it implies that the United Kingdom does not have for many loyalists a natural character of statehood in the way the Southern state has for catholic nationalists . Covenant politics has come to the forefront again with the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 and shows the extent to which the populist politics of the Democratic Unionists is rooted in protestant loyalist tradition . This foundational belief gives meaning to the more popular belief in the right of the people to violence .	78
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	It is important to note that in 191214 the protestant loyalist group saw their right to violence as prior to that of the official state . It is also important to note that they saw the taking of law into their own hands as temporary , and pending the recognition by that state of its mistaken attitude towards them and their right to a degree of autonomy . It [appears] to be increasingly the case that there are two major traditions of identity perception among protestant loyalists . One tradition is the covenant one and is antagonistic to a straightforward nationalist sentiment . It is adhered to by increasing numbers who have become disillusioned with British identity and have seen Paisley 's words about the traitorous nature of British governments become reality as protestant loyalist domination in Ulster has been continuously eroded .	69
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	There did exist the small Northern Ireland Labour Party which disappeared after the fall of Stormont ; but it had been based on industrial workers , particularly in the shipyards , and remained much smaller in size than its Southern counterpart . As Gibbon has noted , the cases of both Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism remain the two most spectacular class alliances in the political history of the British Isles ( 1975 : 3 ) . The cause in both cases appears to be the strength of catholic nationalist and protestant loyalist popular consciousness and the way in which the cultural and material interests of the subordinate classes [appear] to be represented by the alliances themselves and their institutions . By providing core beliefs , and by reinforcing their separateness for both alliances , religious beliefs and institutions equally suppress class divisions , become embroiled in cementing alliances , and help retain the overall divisional structure of Ireland as a whole .

The salvation history of the Bible is coupled with what is seen as a significant period in the history of the protestants of Ireland . The key event in the history of Ireland which [appears] to encapsulate Ulster protestant faith in God through Christ and the destiny of Ulster protestants as a people , is the war of 168991 . William of Orange is seen to have worked the decisive victory at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 . However , that myth is not quite the one which appears to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state .	49

However , that myth is not quite the one which [appears] to have penetrated everyday life , perhaps because the place of the victory is located within the borders of the Southern state . The most powerful myth affecting everyday life narrates the less decisive defence of the city of Londonderry in 1689 . The protestant refugees , inhabitants , and garrison of the city , which was built deliberately with a wall lest a catholic rebellion should ever occur , held the city for fifteen weeks against a poorly equipped catholic Irish army led by James II , the exiled king .	65
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	However , the earthly role of the community , be it protestant or catholic , is not seen as secondary to the religious message , but as either in continuity with or against it . The Calvinist vision of an earthly city in which pastor and politician work in harmony to exclude evil from the lives of all those within the city walls remains a religious outlook for a significant number of protestant loyalists . This is a totalizing view of society , and implies a certain anti - pluralism : freedom of belief and action within certain parameters , which are to be decided either by those who [appear] righteous in the sight of God or by those who , at least , conform in their lawmaking to the advice given to them by the righteous . The very drift of the account of Christian myth and religious political ethics has certain parallels of structure with the siege of Londonderry . These should be noted , before one views the siege as baseline myth for the interpretation of everyday life .	109

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Generally speaking , there is evidence that the church has always tended to support the hegemony of the state qua state . It supported the British state for most of the nineteenth century in Ireland , then supported constitutional politics for home rule ; and when independence came in 1921 , it supported the pro - treaty faction in Southern Ireland and opposed the civil war because that faction was the state . It would [appear] that the popular religious consciousness makes a distinction between violence against the Southern state , whose statehood cannot be questioned , and violence for liberation in the North . Though the extent to which such a consciousness exists is not clear , one aspect of it is beyond dispute : 35 per cent of McGreil 's random sample of Dubliners and 46 per cent of the males in the sample , including a spread from the younger age groups and the more educated , supported the view that the use of violence , while regrettable , has been necessary for the achievement of non - Unionist rights ( Mc Gril 1977 : 387 ) . In any event , there is likely to be significant variation in views as to how far one should condemn or condone this liberationist violence in the North .	75

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	As has already been seen , it was the style of both church and politicians to avoid their mutual consultations being known , which tells us that the secularity of the state at that time was partially a faade , but one which it was felt by both interested parties had to be maintained , probably so as not to confuse the faithful . In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill was going through parliament , the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority , without qualification , is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family , the Church in education , the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions ( Irish Independent , 12 Apr. 1951 , quoted Whyte 1980 : 143 ) . It [appeared] that one of the main sources of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented seems likely . Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used , the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .	146
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Later the hierarchy made it clear that the basis for their objections was the increase in power by the state vis - - vis the liberty and self - reliance of its citizens which such legislation would entail . Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the whole affair is the way Dr Browne handled it . The members of his party [appeared] to know nothing about the opposition of the hierarchy to the earlier Bill , and Dr Browne only found out in October/November 1950 . When he was told of the hierarchy 's opposition to any bill of this kind , Dr Browne , himself secularly inclined , submitted his proposals and arguments to the hierarchy for approval , just as a previous Health Minister , Dr Walsh , had consulted Archbishop McQuaid on a similar matter in 1946 . If a man of such convictions felt it necessary to follow this course , how much more would have his religiously devoted colleagues .	61

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	On the one hand , the laity would not understand the complexity of the issues because of their poor understanding of Christian doctrine and the intricacies of morality ; on the other , the area of the sacred in the political arena was clearly defined , and clear guidance from the clerical church was both necessary and expected by good Christian politicians . What the bishops and the politicians had come up against in the Mother and Child controversy was that this paternalistic conceptualization was intrinsically at odds with the common understanding of democracy . This [appears] to be the first contradiction which the bishops later sought to resolve by withdrawing from the direct contact method . It indicates that a real change did eventually take place after all , in so far as freedom of information and the inappropriateness of direct consultation without public mediation eventually became accepted as something which , at worst , had to be risked and something which , at best , formed an essential task of the construction of a Christian conscience in a Christian society . This , however , was the only contradiction which appears to have been solved by the 1960s .	96

Large sections of the population , the subordinate classes specifically , were desperately in need of improved health care. Many of them [appear] to have been angered and disappointed at the church 's suppression of the proposed scheme . The fact that it was not long after that similar if lesser welfare legislation was introduced is indicative of the public demand and that clerical socio - moral theory did not tally with the people 's experience of reality . The case reveals the extent to which the church as an institution was coupled with the nation .	42
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Hence when Irish clergymen stated that church and state were separate , they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state . But they did and still do remain the authoritative conscience of the nation . In addition , the clergy [appear] to have considerable difficulty in recognizing the transformation which theoretical positions on Christian belief and morality undergo as they are concretized in historical human relationships , doubtless also because of the strong essentialist bias in their perception of socio - ethical issues . Part of the overall argument of this book is that , as the Roman catholic church is principal validator or legitimator of the Southern state along with the concept of the national entity , what that state goes on to do in the field of social ethics cannot be separated out from the responsibilities of the church . This structural link between politics and religion is underlined by the legitimacy the church gives to the state as a whole , by recognizing it simply as society .	45

But a key element remained the considerable filial loyalty the catholic nationalists showed towards their clergy , bishops , and Popes . The authority of the clergy had been second to none during the years of persecution and this [appears] to have strengthened as a direct result of Roman centralization from the 1850s onwards . This respect for authority has appeared throughout the examples given , but it has also been shown to be a respect within certain limits . RELIGION AND LAW IN THE SOUTHERN STATE , 197386	54

Caught between the preaching of the Roman catholic clergy and appeals from protestants and liberal Roman catholics including Dr FitzGerald not to constitutionalize the issue , it would appear that many voters simply stayed away rather than vote against the proposal .

Concessions would only be required once a united Ireland was being negotiated ( New Ireland Forum 19834 : xii . 11 ) .	74

FitzGerald had been determined as far back as 1964 ( 1964 ; 1972 ) to make constitutional changes to those articles which [appeared] to alienate Northern protestant opinion . After arriving in office as Taoiseach for a second time in 1983 , he proceeded to collect opinions on such issues from various quarters . From the Roman catholic hierarchy , he solicited the response that the church believed in the indissolubility of marriage .	73

Some members of the anti - abortion lobby had apparently been indicating the weak moral stance of protestants on the issue . The Church of Ireland [appears] to have had this in mind when it invited the well - known English Roman catholic marriage consultant , Dr Jack Dominian , to provide a report on divorce for the Church of Ireland General Synod . As Bishop Empey argued to the synod : Somehow we have to nail the lie that permissiveness flows from the Church of Ireland and that morality is the sole possession of but one Church in this land ( Irish Times , 22 May 1986 ) . In submitting his report , Dominian stated :	44
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	There seemed to be the fairly uncomplicated desire among the community to see all the children attend the same school , as an expression of relationships existing within the community . It is likely that children have the important function in a new housing area of bringing parents and neighbours together , particularly when there is a lack of other social amenities a characteristic of new housing areas in and around Dublin in the 1970s . The children probably [appear] as a source from which to develop new relationships and the immediate perception is to translate this experience into scholastic terms . The absence of a non - Roman catholic school in the immediate area and the nave belief that they were empowered in some way to have a say in what type of school should appear on their housing estate there was a small Roman catholic school which was to be expanded to cater for the growth of the population may have sharpened catholic parents ' interest in having an integrated school . There were at this point no apparent difficulties experienced between the majority of estate members and no significant source of conflict , that is until the question of a multi - denominational school itself became such a source .	79
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	But where other churches have owned their own schools , as does the Church of Ireland in the South , a similar position has been adopted , though the reasons for the position have been on different grounds . A proposal before the Church of Ireland synod in May 1979 to support interdenominational education was defeated , despite pressure from its ecumenical lobby . The main grounds [appeared] to be the danger which it might pose to the small Southern protestant minority by encouraging mixed marriages . However , no evidence favouring such a contention has ever been produced . Harry MacAdoo , then the Church of Ireland archbishop of Dublin , on several occasions put forward the argument that Southern protestants were a minority group with their own culture and traditions , and thus deserved to have schools for themselves in order to hand on their own traditions .	67
appear.v	*190902	to seem. 'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	This attitude was amply revealed in the results of the competition ( Inside the Pub ) launched jointly by The Architectural Review and The Brewers ' Society in 1949 . In October of that year the AR regretted that nearly all competition entries had evaded the key problem and had signally failed to achieve the genuine pub atmosphere . Contemporary design , the magazine 's editor regretted , because it has no roots in the vernacular idiom will not [appear] immediately familiar , whilst the mock - Tudor and the mock - Georgian styles which have been so prevalent no matter how misguided in themselves have sprung from a genuine attempt to preserve a traditional atmosphere . As pub designer Tim May noted in his address to CAMRA 's AGM of 1990 : By any objective standards , the competition was a disaster . The response of the 1960s and 70s to this failure to capture the essence of the traditional pub was the ruthlessly - applied corporate image and the proliferation of fun theme - pubs .	79

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The current obsession with pseudo - Victorian and other bogus historical styles imposed willy - nilly and quite regardless of the true age of the pub , seems to suggest two things ; firstly that pub designers and fitters have completely lost their way , both in recognising and respecting what is genuinely old and in looking for a wholeheartedly modern pub style ; secondly that there is some king of awareness , correct but misguided , that people like their pubs to look old and feel familiar . The great pity of this is that most pubs are old , yet the proper opportunity to celebrate this has already been squandered . There [appears] to be no creative public vision which will help the survival of the pub or help ensure a healthy and varied pub stock . History , indeed , tends to show that public intervention can have the effect of reinforcing rather than curbing market excesses . It was the licensing system and licensing controls , after all , which helped to foster Britain 's peculiar brewery tie and concentrate pub ownership in the hands of the brewers in the first place ; and it was the same system which connived at and partly encouraged the modern contagion of open - plan pub designs .	114

Despite what brewers ' architects often allege , the life expectancy of such plastic window units is proving remarkably short as little as five years for the fittings , and twenty years for the plastic itself , which is exhibiting distinct tendencies to warp and discolour with age . Thus the arguments for easier maintenance and greater longevity of plastic windows [appear] to have little foundation in fact an argument often ignored by the brewers . Given their prime location in the centre of towns and on major thoroughfares , Georgian coaching inns are frequently prime targets for refurbishment . Such redevelopment is often unnecessary and detrimental ; the end product of such schemes is all too often a sham - historical parody , re - creating an idealised , sanitised Britain that never actually existed .	109

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	Countless other pubs which date from the Georgian period , or at least incorporate a significant element of Georgian building work , have suffered similar fates . National brewing giants such as Allied or Whitbread , though , are not the only villains ; small independent firms can be just as insensitive in their treatment of their tied houses . Claire Hunt , for instance , noted in 1988 of North Western brewers Robinsons that they [appear] on the whole to be fairly oblivious to the individual merits of their historic pubs . One key problem with the more domestically - scaled Georgian pubs is that they were often originally conceived as , or converted from , modest homes . The numerous internal partitions that result have often proved anathema to modern - day breweries .	76

Its sound provided the first syllable of Poirot 's name poir , and for the second one need look no further than the French word perdreau , meaning a young partridge . The unusual juxtaposition of these two words can only be a subconscious association in the author 's mind with the well - known carol , The Twelve Days of Christmas whose repetitive chorus ends , And a partridge in a pear - tree .	77

In such cases , the reverse punch may be given simply because the referee failed to recognise the snap punch . Another important factor is the referee 's line of sight .	44

All hell rules over the man who is angry , says the Talmud , and by September 1939 , when Leonard was beginning to come to terms with the thresholds of life 's reality , hell was ruling the world , or at least [appeared] to be . War had been declared , and the fate of Czechoslovakia , Austria and Poland was sealed , as it would be for several other countries .

We should note that it is the spice - box of earth .

The presence of movement is one of our main criteria for being alive , and yet infant movements [appear] at least to be random , reflexive and undirected .

In a somewhat more subtle form , these tendencies continue into later childhood . Martin Braine found that if children between five and six years of age are shown a standard visual illusion such as a stick in water [appearing] to be broken , by light refraction they will distinguish correctly between looks ? and really ? questions , but that if they are asked the neutral question Is the stick straight or broken ? they will say that it is broken . The neutral question is interpreted phenomenally , where an older child ( around seven years ) interprets it in a realist fashion .

( Another useful illusion is that of the instantaneity of experience . We have to view a stimulus for a finite time before it generates a perception , but that perception [appears] to us to occur instantaneously rather than fading into view like the Cheshire cat . ) But there is no way we can test for this hypothetical delay . Subjects are always limited to making judgements about experiences ; experimenters are stuck with observing physical events like evoked potentials , verbal reports and button presses .	63

That PH is genuinely recognizing faces , however , cannot be seriously questioned . This pattern of findings would [appear] to be impossible to accommodate from the viewpoint of phenomenology . As Bauer put it in a recent BBC television discussion of covert recognition , Our normal experience of perception , of seeing objects or faces as an all or none process , is a trick that the brain plays on us . It is a trick that should no longer fool anyone except phenomenologists .	57

A quantitative correlation between the objective intensity of stimulus and the pattern of neural activity was subsequently demonstrated by physiologists recording from individual fibres . Since the work of S. S. Stevens in the 1930s and later , it has been recognized that , although the Weber - Fechner Law holds for many sorts of sensory experience , the exponent varies widely ; nevertheless , the principle of a quantitative correlation between external stimulus , neural activity and experienced sensation remains intact and now [appears] to be well - established . So much for the basic laws . The repeated confirmation of the correlation between the physical characteristics of the stimulus and the characteristics of the neural activity it triggers , and between the characteristics of the stimulus and that of the subjective sensation , has encouraged the belief that our sensations are in some sense to be understood in terms of a set of stimulation levels ( spiking frequencies ) in the appropriate sensory pathways .	121

Where income such as an occupational pension or Retirement Pension is paid into a bank or building society account on , for example , a monthly or four - weekly basis , in some cases this has been treated as capital resulting in a possible reduction of benefit . In effect it [appears] that the pension has been assessed both as income and capital . The circular states that income to cover a certain period should be ignored as capital for that period . For example if a person who has 3,000 capital receives a monthly pension of 200 paid into their bank account , this should not be assessed as an increase in savings unless it remains unspent at the time the next payment is due .	78

This [appears] to make the concept of locally - available core services a rather uncertain one . As time goes on , the Government envisages more and more hospitals becoming NHS Trusts , with powers to negotiate what services they will provide .

Fokine said that every phrase of his dance was a gesture , and explained : Undoubtedly an arabesque has many meanings but only when it [appears] as an idealised gesture . It is a very apparent gesture ( in Les Sylphides ) , a yearning for height , for distance , an inclination of the whole body , a movement of the entire being .

The moment can be as the dancer pauses momentarily in a pose , as a comma in the middle or as a full stop at the end of a sentence . Or the moment can be an important point in an overall design to fill space , such as the moment in a grand jet en avant when the dancer 's two legs are at an equal height from the ground and he or she [appears] to travel onwards effortlessly through space . It can also be the moment when a dancer moves into a pirouette and spins before holding a pose .

There are also the exciting poses that come at the end of some of Ashton 's pas de deux as the two characters declare their love , for example , when Oberon cradles Titania in his arms at the end of The Dream and , even more excitingly , when Colas lifts Lise high on one arm it the end of their dance in Act II of La Fille Mai Garde as if to crown her queen of the harvest In some modern classical ballets too little attention is paid to the momentary holding of a pose as the focus of a picture to sum up as it were what has gone before .	79

There is no light and shade and this way of using the pointes has nothing to do with giving a finishing touch to such dances as those fur Petipa 's Aurora and the Six Fairies in The Sleeping Beauty to make them seem lighter than air . Nor does it resemble the bravura footing of Kitri in the Don Quixote pas de deux or the passages in Ashton 's Ondine where his ballerina [appears] to be floating through water . Nor can it be compared with the ballerina 's dance in Rhapsodie where she wafts to and fro as if in a dream before breaking into her solo . The spacing of such steps on pointe is so minute and so fast that it is not possible to see the change of feet as one succeeds the other.	85

'He appears smart, but I have doubts'.	metaphorical	0.6396628826969384	The originality of so much of Ashton 's and MacMillan 's choreography fur classical ballets lies in the way they follow the basic principles and rules in order to create an infinite variety of enchanements from the traditional vocabulary of steps , and yet discard the conventions . Birthday Offering Ashton 's technical virtuosity ( The Royal Ballet ) Choreographers who do not adhere strictly to the old conventions of court etiquette realise that their total design will flow more easily because their dancers ' behaviour will [appear] more spontaneous and natural . For example : each soloist need not begin with a formal bow to a king or to the audience , nor end with another bow or considered pose ; but such behaviour may be included if the choreographer wishes to locate dance in a particular century and probably a palace in which the story unfolds . Many new members of an audience have been known to object to the applause greeting the last bow .	87

They have become part of the spacious ports de bras used during the dance . They conform to the same technical rules as ports de bras and must [appear] to pass through the centre line of the arm from shoulder to finger - tips and move within the two circles drawn by the elbows and hands . Two of the best examples occur when the Lilac Fairy casts the spell that sends Aurora to sleep in The Sleeping Beauty , ( Until a prince comes , sees her , falls in love and kisses her awake . ' and when Siegfried swears to marry and save Odette after she has told him how the wicked Von Rothbart turned her into a Swan ( Swan Lake , Act 11 ) .	63

Thus the angular and straight lines drawn by the legs were also drawn simultaneously by the arms and hands , which were allowed to cross the centre line of the body , very often with a twist sideways at the waist . This made the dancers [appear] as if they were a moving frieze . Something that David Bintley was also to achieve later in his Sons of Horus ( 1985 ) . Ashton too has created two oriental styled ballets in which the delicacy of the hands and arms drew attention to the way such subtle movements can take the place of words .	80

The movements were strongly influenced by the stylised Bugako players and were appropriate to each scene , but oddly enough the whole [appeared] too static , as if a series of japanese prints was being paraded before the audience . At this time a MacMillan ballet was expected to be , above all , about dancing .

The hornpipe is not exclusive to England , which many seem to think , even though Petipa in his ballet The Daughter of Pharaoh included a hornpipe to represent the Thames in a spectacular scene where the four greatest rivers of the world met under the sea .	22

Despite Puck 's wild leaps , crazy antics and turns , the clumsy attempts by the Mechanicals to cut capers and Bottom 's efforts sur les pointes , it is Oberon and Titania 's dancing that commands the stage as well as those trapped in the magicked Athenian wood . from their first confrontation , when Titania [appears] wilfully aloof as Oberon tries to exert his authority , to their final reconciliation , they stand out as a true Fairy King and Queen , who are not beyond suffering the moods and emotions of We mortals here .

The additional exercises certainly led to a greater use of patterns made by the dancers rolling or posturing over and on the floor . This gave greater depth to most of the patterns , but often made the dancers [appear] earthbound . It also led to closer contacts between the dancers as they moved from picture to picture within the design . From time to time this can be very beautiful but because there is a lack of continuity in the dance movement from one picture to the next , the resultant work often appears static .	113

Dostoevsky 's own attempt to suggest how he disposes his reader in relation to these events goes as follows : Narration by the author , a sort of invisible but omniscient being who nevertheless does n't leave him meaning his hero ' for a moment So , after [appearing] to settle for third - person narrative , he doubles back on himself and leaves us to make what we can of an omniscient author who is bound hand and foot to a far from omniscient protagonist .

In some early drafts Raskolnikov commits suicide , and the striking thing here is that it 's never suggested he does so out of remorse or because he thinks he 's going to get caught or even from some vaguer , larger self - loathing . He [appears] to lose interest in life . He is bored .

One of the marvels of Crime and Punishment is its clear distinguishing , untainted by clinical knowingness , of Svidrigailov 's and Raskolnikov 's ways of being ( as the saying is ) not with us . Svidrigailov [appears] not to notice insults and rudenesses . Nothing signifies for him , yet he seizes on details with a toneless precision , almost pedantry : when Raskolnikov calls him a gambler he says he is actually a card - sharper . Observing Raskolnikov wince at the idea of eternity as a bathhouse , he murmurs with a vague smile that he would certainly have made it like that himself .	97

It will [appear] mechanical , when plucked out of the huge and vital narrative flow , that Dostoevsky has given him a sickly dark yellow complexion as a mark of his belonging to Petersburg . Nevertheless he does possess a yellow face as opposed to lodging in a yellow room , or handling yellow money , or being issued ( the bureaucracy ! ) with a yellow ticket . He also belongs for the reason suggested by Svidrigailov ; Petersburg is the administrative centre of Russia , and Porfiry occupies his position there as an official examining magistrate within the metropolitan and national legal system .	23

Stavrogin ca n't , and in our definitive text does n't , claim to be a decent man or to have any other thing to be ; all his letter indicates is a deathlike mime or sleepwalk within behaviour patterns determined by upbringing , class , and kind . This must [appear] implausibly neat . But so do many things once the dust of composition has settled and the builder 's yard of notebooks and rejected drafts can be studied at leisure . The neatness comes afterwards ; it gets imposed when a long and laborious and very untidy process is shortcircuited by the observation ( which Dostoevsky himself may never have made ) of a direct link between Stavrogin and the underground man.	69

Indeed the overall triumph of art in this case is that the novel walks out into our fact rather than ourselves entering its fiction : a very primitive and absolute form of consumer capitulation . Dostoevsky has an impudent way of making his narrator declare As a chronicler I confine myself to presenting events exactly as they happened , and it 's not my fault if they [appear] incredible like the son of the house writing home about his time on the North - West Frontier of India .

The Possessed looked for a long time like losing its way , and Dostoevsky would surely concede that in so far as the design was , to use his own word , tendentious , this was bound to be so . And yet a novel does n't write itself , even if some of the very greatest ones [appear] to ; it is written by a man with aims and preferences . But these just happen to be his , he ca n't prescribe them for art ; what he wants to say must come to terms with what the form allows him ; art refuses to be imposed upon , to be dictated to , and Dostoevsky 's dictum will stand .

Yeast is made up of millions of tiny fungus cells which literally go berserk when confronted by a liquid rich with sugars . Within a few hours a scum [appears] on top of the wort and this rapidly builds up into a great yellowy - brown crust as the yeast turns the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide . The system used in Britain to produce mild , bitter , stout and strong ales is called warm fermentation , using a special type of top fermenting yeast . This means that the yeast , encouraged by the warmth of the wort and the temperature of the brewery , works quickly and vigorously on top of the wort to produce alcohol .	46

She begins by recalling a remark made to her a long time ago by Larkin , about difficulties encountered in his private life a remark which consisted of a joke to do with the impossibility of relations between men and women , followed by the notion that women ought really to marry each other , followed by but that would be wrong , would n't it ?

Much of this is due to the face that , following the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on pub ownership , many breweries are actually moving out of brewing itself and concentrating instead on pub management an area where they believe they stand to make the greatest profits . At the end of the 80s the famous Manchester firm of Boddingtons sold its brewing operation to Whitbread ; yet during 1988 alone , Claire Hunt has [noted] , Boddingtons undertook the refurbishment of 50 of their tied houses . More recently , at the end of 1990 the regional brewing giant Greenall Whitley announced that it was closing both its breweries at Warrington and Nottingham ( formerly the independent Shipstone 's brewery ) to concentrate solely on running pubs contracting out its beer to be produced by former rivals Allied Breweries .

We have a way of talking , and thus a way of thinking , about thoughts as if they were sentences in the head ; and it is worth [noting] that Fodor ( for example in Psychosemantics ) regards folk psychology as providing a rough but reliable account of mental life and behaviour .

We must approach observations of linguistic behaviour with the same careful attitude as we approach other kinds of behaviour or indeed as we approach our electrophysiological observations . It is also worth [noting] that correlations between ERPs and behaviour are never perfect , perhaps because of masking of some of the ERPs by random fluctuations of the background EEG . An individual event which normally gives a particular ERP may sometimes yield nothing and the ERP may sometimes occur in the absence of the evoking event . It is always the case that averaging over tens of trials is necessary to give consistent results , particularly with endogenous ERPs .	99

Holdaway ( 1983 : 72 ) [noted] how lawyers were seen by Hilton 's police as a threat because they unmask police practice , and , along with doctors and social workers , they were considered challengers . This led some policemen to enjoy the sport which the court room offered ( Holdaway 1983 : 74 ) . In the case of policemen at Easton , this sport is situationally constrained by the common - sense knowledge they build up of the court room setting and its players .	62

As Furlong [noted] with respect to teachers ( 1977 : 163 ) , their typifications of problem pupils were also heavily conditioned by specialist sociological knowledge ( from socially deprived families ) or common - sense notions of psychoanalysis ( never had a father ) . These stereotypes can become deployed to explain persistent offending among the young even when there is little evidence that they are appropriate .

It was [noted] however that what was contemptuously called the village intelligentsia still maintained a hostile attitude to the Party and the Red Army . At the end of February news filtered in that no peasants were willing to join the military ranks , and there were quite a few desertions . The greater part of the required prodnalog ( tax in kind ) had been collected , but several villages were fractious due to silly actions by some officials .	59

This depleted the famine areas further , and sparked off new hatred amongst the peasants . In the subsequent scramble for survival and enrichment which mounted towards the end of 1922 , it was not surprising that those who were slightly better off often took a kind of revenge in driving hard bargains with their poorer neighbours , as has been [noted] earlier . The intermediary between local bodies and Moscow were the guberniia Commissions for the Relief of the Starving . The Tsaritsyn Commission was set up on 8 August 192 1 , and like its counterparts in other gubernii , were very closely modelled on Pomgol , the all - Russian organ in Moscow .	91

Further , he was not unwilling to show enterprise . The move towards cash limits , cuts in current expenditure , and a generally monetarist policy were heralded by a speech to the TUC in September 1976 , which ( as [noted] ) reflected the influence of his son - in - law , Peter Jay . Again , on education , Callaghan attempted to promote new standards of literacy and numeracy , based on an agreed core curriculum in schools . In foreign policy , while seldom innovative , he did try to carve out new relationships with Britain 's new European partners , especially through his close personal association with Helmut Schmidt , the West German chancellor and a fellow social democrat , as well as maintaining his contacts with the new US Democratic administration of Jimmy Carter .	54

The Scottish and Welsh Devolution Bills made steady progress through the Commons , until both became law in 1978 . But there was much evidence of divided counsels on both the Labour and Conservative sides , as has been [noted] above . Indeed , the government had to make major concessions during the committee stage , especially to Labour critics . The amendment by an expatriate Scot , George Cunningham ( Labour , Islington ) , by ensuring that a 40 per cent vote of the electorate ( not simply of those voting ) would have to be achieved for a devolution bill to go through and for a repeal order not to be tabled , made devolution , at least for Wales , virtually an impossibility .	57

It lay rather in the company it kept , the classes with which it was associated . As [noted] , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a degree at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different , say from that of Edward Heath , whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who , like Mrs Thatcher , went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .

There were factors at play in the association of theatrical cross - dressing and sexual transgressions . Not only did prostitutes frequent the theatre , but the street transvestite was sometimes associated with prostitution and possibly sodomy : Henriques [notes] a regulation dating from 1480 forbidding prostitutes to dress as men in public , and remarks : This masquerading presumably would have meant an added inducement to sodomy ( Prostitution and Society , ii . 88 ) .

'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	The final report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth drew attention to the stability in the distribution of income in the post - war period . Some redistribution had occurred between 1938 and 1949 , but if one ignores the top 1 per cent of income earners , there had been little change up to 1979 . Under the Conservative government , as [noted] , the tax system became less progressive , with the major reductions being made at the top end of the tax range and there were increases in national insurance and the nonprogressive indirect taxes . The tax cuts for the top income earners , the increase in share prices over the decade , and the effects of the recession have sharpened economic differentials in the Thatcher period . Although the Commission was dissolved in 1979 , the 1985 volume of Inland Revenue Annual Statistics found that between 1979 and 1983 the most wealthy 50 per cent of the adult population increased its share of total marketable wealth from 79 83 per cent to 80 4 per cent .	68

She also exploited her control of the agenda of Cabinet and powers to appoint members of Cabinet committees or groups and draw up their terms of reference . The appointment of supporters on the Cabinet committee dealing with economic strategy has already been [noted] . She chairs two of the most important ad hoc Cabinet committees , OD , dealing with foreign affairs and Northern Ireland , and EA , covering economic strategy , privatization , trade union legislation , and the European Community matters . The reduction in the number of Cabinet meetings ( 45 50 per annum , about half of the post - war norm ) , and of Cabinet papers ( 60 70 , or one - sixth of the figure in the 1950s ) , and the appointment of fewer Cabinet committees have reduced the opportunities for collective deliberation .	65

Aware of American dislike of centralized control , he confined his remarks to generalities about open trade welding nations together for mutual benefit . As [noted] above , Pan American Airways and its chairman , Juan Trippe , had the ear of Congress and president Roosevelt , and fed fears of British dominance in the air . It is quite true that the Americans were at least as worried about the British as the British were about them , but for very different reasons . The Americans were intimidated by the possible British routes allowed by Commonwealth and Empire airfields the world over .	48

For example , hunters and gatherers were placed low while irrigating cultivators were placed high , then these activities were linked directly with such institutions as rules concerning property , the status of women , the type of government , and the kinship system . In this , Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just [noted] . However , Ancient Society also differed from earlier work because of the high quality of the scholarly work on which it was based , because of the sympathy of the writer for primitives , and because it not only defined stages but in many cases suggested mechanisms which explained why one stage should change to another . This last element , perhaps more than any other , is crucial for understanding why Marx and Engels attached so much more importance to the work of Morgan than they did to the work of the other evolutionist anthropologists whom they read .	72
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	Anthropology and the work of Morgan were harnessed to the political task of rewriting history . There was another political task to which anthropology was put in the work of Marx , and for this the writings of Morgan also proved particularly appropriate . The use of anthropology which we have already [noted] can be called historical . Marx and Engels were interested in primitive cultures because they wanted to construct a general history and theory of society in order to explain the coming to be of capitalism . The second way in which they use anthropological material we can call rhetorical .	52
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	According to the theory , the people who used such a system of terms did not themselves , however , practise such a type of marriage but actually practices the next stage . This was because according to Morgan kin terms lag behind . As a result , the evidence for this second stage in the history of marriage depends entirely on the two assumptions which we have already [noted] . One that patterns of kin terms indicate types of marriage , and second , that the presence of such a pattern is a guide to a previous state of affairs . The Polynesians , according to this way of seeing things , had a system of kinship terms , which indicated , not the marriage system which they practised , but the marriage system which they had practised in the past .	69
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	Engels re - echoes The German Ideology in showing that far from the State being the repository of justice , it is the repository of exploitation , but here he does this by use of genuine anthropological materials . According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes , and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses . This is a crucial proposition which we have already [noted] and which will be discussed again later in this book . It is by means of this idea that the State is linked with the earlier part of the origin of kinship and marriage . Classes and private property grow out of the family and together these various factors lead to the break - up of the gens .	80
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	Admittedly if the component family abandons its claim to the land this will revert to the commonality but that does not mean that there are no such claims in normal circumstances . In other words , a declaration of common ownership of the land of the gens does not imply free and equal access to all within the gens . Marx , in particular , had already [noted] this fact in several places , but he explained the phenomenon of internal division as a transitional one ; as evidence of a stage in which private property and individual families were coming in and undermining the communal descent group . A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence . In any case , the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .	67

'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5931899641577061	Finally , since there is no simple correlation between high status for women and matriliny and since there is no simple connection between matriliny and type of technology , it follows that there is no simple connection between primitive technology and high status for women . Among living hunters and gatherers , women may have a comparatively high status as amongst the Mbuti of Africa , or a comparatively low status among most Australian Aborigines The issue is far more complicated and it is only fair to [note] that we have not reached a stage of knowledge when we can easily say what explains the status of women among the different peoples of the world . The status of women has several aspects which themselves do not go simple together . By and large the evidence which Engels and his contemporaries saw as significant of the high status of women in primitive societies is often wrong or does not signify what it was believed to mean .	87

These include delamination of wrought iron which arises with corrosion , owed to the presence of slag in the material between layers of almost pure iron . Also , it should be [noted] that there were no satisfactory ways of forming structural connections in cast iron by any processes such as welding , brazing or soldering . If such techniques appear to have been used , the structure should be regarded as suspect , because all reputable Victorian engineers were aware of the risks of making connections by these methods . Where these is no need for a retained iron structure to accept enlarged loads and it is apparent that the metal members are in food condition , not having been subjected to detrimental modifications , the chief consideration in re - using the installation is to achieve an acceptable standard of fire resistance .	42

On a mixed farm , there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle , while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops . It is interesting to [note] that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them . Where land was readily acquired so that the farmstead could be enlarged in a logical way , rather than the haphazard development which resulted from the erection of buildings on whatever sites became available , individual buildings within the grouping were sited so as to maximise efficiency . Threshed straw had to be taken from the barns to the cattle or the horses for use as feed or litter .	84

An example of Fry 's description of Czanne 's development dealt with colour : When Czanne uses colour we [note] that at each nodal point of the interplay of planes , Czanne marks this sequence by a series of small washes of various colours , modulating generally from violet to greenish , or bluish grey . His aim in this was as far as possible to translate changes of tones into changes of colour , feeling that only by this method could the full saturation and pressure of colour be realized . I cannot doubt that this peculiar method which gave such valuable results in water - colour , influenced Czanne to apply it at least to the early stages of his oil paintings , and that gradually it grew to be his habitual practice in the succeeding period .	48

If anything , the return of the land to the practising farmers by the land Acts would have strengthened such a morality . It is also interesting to [note] that the issue of land inheritance was a key reason why the Irish population voted no in the referendum on divorce in 1986 . That the local priests continued to play a significant part in the regulation of local sexual morality from the beginning of the state is shown by accounts of boy meets girl from the 1920s . For example : In 1931 we got a new Parish Priest .	95

The rhetorical use of anthropology inevitably involved Marx and Engels in a search of the anthropological literature for examples of opposites to the institutions of capitalism . Since their work focused on certain topics it was natural that they particularly looked for evidence relating to these topics , and as examples of the rhetorical use of anthropology three such central topics can be [noted] here in a preliminary way . These are the relationships existing between people engaged in the process of production , the relations of production , property and the family . Marx 's work in Capital is focused on the nature of the social relationship which existed between workers and capitalists : the capitalist relations of production .	102

Seamus Mallon , MP of the SDLP may have seen the Hillsborough agreement of 1985 as a step towards a united Ireland , but some of his co - politicians in the party would not share that view . Perhaps one should [note] the care with which the present leader of the party , John Hume , chooses his words over the future of the North . He is careful not to promote the theme of reunification , but talks of discovering a new way , setting up structures of co - operation in the North between the two Northern Communities , with the support of the Southern government .

In the light of high political intent and peasant sentiment , let us now return to the market town of Roslavl ' and examine Party and urban reactions there in 1922 . It is interesting to [note] that the local Party cell 's initial report for January , that is , prior to the central decree of 16 February on church valuables , already concentrates on two things possible rifts within the Church , and the flow of ecclesiastical monies . A very large amount had already been collected on a voluntary basis by religious groups for the Famine , making it seem almost superfluous or extortionate to do more .

Some people disliked this book very much . The nonconformists [noted] that he did not unchurch them but were not happy with his plea that they recognize bishops to be essential to the Church . Bethune - Baker and his school at Cambridge disliked the anti - rational quality in the book the scandalousness of the Church and its gospel and took several more marks off Hoskyns for begetting such a child .

This is normally found in the first part of sleep ( see below ) . It is interesting to [note] that severe physical exercise in the daytime is sometimes associated with increased deep sleep the following night ; perhaps there is a link here between deep sleep , an increase in growth hormone release , and the growth of muscular tissue that is produced by exercise . Other hormones rise at night also ( fig 3.2 ) . These include cortisol ( which rises later in the night as the body prepares for waking and is strongly influenced by the body clock ) ; antidiuretic hormone ( which is one of the ways in which fluid formation by the kidney is reduced at night , see Chapter 6 ) ; and the male sex hormone , testosterone , as well as some of the hormones that control the reproductive cycle in women .	53

The second thing to [note] is that each offence carries its own scale of penalties , and penalties for one offence are not added on to penalties imposed for a different offence .

In a letter to the Irish premier in 1947 , while an extensive health bill was going through parliament , the bishops pointed out that to claim such powers for the public authority , without qualification , is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family , the Church in education , the rights of the medical profession and voluntary institutions ( Irish Independent , 12 Apr. 1951 , quoted Whyte 1980 : 143 ) . It appeared that one of the main [sources] of the bishops ' opposition was the authoritarian nature of the legislation . That the bishops were affected by the opposition of the medical profession to the scheme clearly they stood to lose money and independence if such a scheme were implemented seems likely . Whereas similar provisions in other countries were mainly designed to provide facilities which could or could not be used , the Irish ones were to be compulsory and there was to be no choice of doctor .	152

I have now supplied sufficient evidence of Agatha Christie 's erudition and remarkable range of [source] - material to silence the most sceptical critic of my thesis . And I think I should definitely be awarded my doctorate as soon as possible . OSBERT MINT , April 1967	33
source.n	source%1:10:01::	(a publication (or a passage from a publication) that is referred to; 'he carried an armful of references back to his desk'; 'he spent hours looking for the source of that quotation')	literal	_	My essay will trace the pattern of references to other literary sources of which the author herself was sometimes no more than subliminally aware . Though there were clearly classical influences on Agatha Christie 's work most obviously in the collection The Labours of Hercules they are not within the province of this study , particularly since the subject has been expertly covered by other scholars . It is my intention to trace only the English language [sources] for the creation of Hercule Poirot . The first unarguable influence on Agatha Christie 's writings can be found in one of the Digressions in Beowulf . The killing in Hrothgar 's meadhall described in the ensuing passage was clearly the origin of the many Country House murders which were to feature in Hercule Poirot 's investigations .	77

The resources available to her are excellent ; the library has an extensive stock of books , long runs of periodicals , press cuttings , and up - to - date facilities to find relevant material . Among the [sources] she will find are critical reviews , articles , catalogues and books about New York painting of the 1940s and 1950s , which will remind her that Pollock died in 1956 . There is no shortage of writing about Pollock ; like other star artists , he has an embarrassingly large number of apologists , but fortunately there are select bibliographies which can guide her to key publications . There may , however , be questions in her mind about the choices open to her : how will the information in a catalogue differ from what is to be found in a monograph ?	89

Perhaps the best place to begin reading Piaget in the original is Piaget and Inhelder , The Psychology of the Child . Piaget 's The Child 's Construction of Reality ( 1955 ) is probably the best [source] of the constructivist thesis . Boden has written an excellent shod introduction to the theory . Piaget is not the only constructivist .	39

It is literature within the last three centuries , then , that provides the main choices for a reader . The advice offered here is that a reader should ignore what category of writing a book or article may come under , since helpful art criticism may be found in all sorts of [sources] . There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's catalogue , or to neglect popular magazines ; as for writing in various academic disciplines , there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic . The reader 's question of a book or an article should be what function the writing is able or unable to perform ?	76

( The Third Law of Aerodynamics states quite clearly that what ever you do you are knackered ) . Incidentally I got that information on the third law from a very reliable [source] . Frank was a retired boffin I think from British Aerospace . He came here five or six years ago on one of our short courses to learn veneering .	48
source.n	source%1:10:01::	(a publication (or a passage from a publication) that is referred to; 'he carried an armful of references back to his desk'; 'he spent hours looking for the source of that quotation')	literal	_	His genesis was part of a much longer creative process and must be seen as the culmination of eleven centuries of English literary history . Though Agatha Christie was properly reticent about the breadth of her reading , it is clear to the informed student of her works that they reflect a much broader and deeper literary frame of reference than is usually admitted to this particular author . My essay will trace the pattern of references to other literary [sources] of which the author herself was sometimes no more than subliminally aware . Though there were clearly classical influences on Agatha Christie 's work most obviously in the collection The Labours of Hercules they are not within the province of this study , particularly since the subject has been expertly covered by other scholars . It is my intention to trace only the English language sources for the creation of Hercule Poirot .	80

Of course , all sources of information must be confirmed as credible [sources] could be using AI as a propaganda tool . We are well aware of this danger and do n't blindly accept what people say , states Malcolm Smart . It comes down to applying a judgement based on the background knowledge we 've acquired from 30 years of monitoring and reporting human rights .	21

The 1990 figures , provided more recently by the Ministry of Justice , show a dramatic increase to 447 death sentences , mostly for murder under aggravating circumstances . The same [source] reports that 190 executions took place last year . AI welcomes the publication of statistics on the death penalty , as well as current proposals to limit its scope . However , it remains concerned that there has been no stay on sentences or executions pending the review of existing legislation .	54

A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone . Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other [sources] ; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate , details of pictures often being poorly represented , leaving an artist 's techniques , materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies . The reader can hope , all the same , that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures , and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's achievement .	50
