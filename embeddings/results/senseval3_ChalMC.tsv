At their trial , the judge is believed to have [added] 25 per cent to each sentence specifically because the police had carried out the attack while operating in their official capacity . In April AI learned that warrants had been issued for the arrest of two police officers and a civilian in connection with the killing of 17 - year - old Anstraum Aman Villagrn Morales . Anstraum Villagrn was shot and killed on 25 June 1990 in Guatemala City by two uniformed police officers .	30

Even though the gap between clerical and lay religious intellectuals has closed , with clergy being left behind in some areas , the clerics remain the true cognoscenti in religious matters , and are expected to be so by the laity . This has always [added] to the clergy 's spiritual authority and status , and has tended to merge with the authority claimed by the clergy in matters of faith and morals , with the high clergy deciding what constitutes matters of faith and morals . The attitude towards authority within the church partnered the perception of the spiritual life . The clergy were and still are in a special position , holding power over the laity because of it .	70

However , this increase in speed must not be relied on if the launch is too slow and the pilot wants more speed , because the cause of a slow launch may be the beginning of a power failure , in which case steepening up in the hope of creating more speed would be dangerous . During a winch launch the potential load on the glider is at a maximum near the top of the launch , when the pull of the cable [adds] directly to the weight of the glider .

The Hastings 20m scheme was celebrated by a successful Gala Day on 27 April when unlimited travel over the line for only 1 was available and more formally on 6 May when the Queen Mother ( Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports ) travelled over the line in the Royal Train .

In practice it is quite complex because you need at least six lasers to trap a clump of atoms ; the lasers also have to be tuned to the natural movement of the atoms . Otherwise the effect is to [add] heat energy rather than remove it . What Wieman has done as well as reaching the lowest temperature on record is to simplify what has been an immensely complex piece of laboratory apparatus .

For Pound undoubtedly made the poem more obscure by asking for the excision of some transitional and bridging passages where the language was not at full pressure , but on the other hand he caused to be removed some extended sections which , being plainly extraneous , could only have [added] to readers ' bafflement . Moreover in some important respects Pound was more old - fashioned than Eliot . As his later disastrous interventions in politics would make clear , he was a realist in quite a simple - minded sense , one who was concerned for public life , and believed ( like activists of the Left ) that a poet had the right and the duty to act in and upon that life quite directly ; whereas the oddly distant weariness of Eliot 's political pronouncements , even when he was most engag as editor of True Criterion , revealed a man for whom the psychological reality of private torments took priority over any reality which announced itself as social and public .	76

The emphasis on the mentality and immateriality of sense experience was associated with the denial that there was anything special about intellect . Even whilst developing the modern immaterialist notion of consciousness , the eighteenth - century empiricists and others were attacking the dignity of intellect and assimilating it to sensory activity by treating thoughts as mere [images] . As well as being a defence of mind , therefore , the early modern philosophy , through its nominalism , was also an attack on it .

Sinfield believed that they were often irredeemably tainted by ideology , at best to be read only in historical terms , or subject to symptomatic readings , seeking the fractures and fissures in the mystified surface of the text that showed the true ideological conditions in which it was produced . Against this , Ryan advanced the humanistic belief that the major canonical texts are not inherently reactionary , and that they contain implicit [images] and models of human freedom which transcend their immediate historical context and which later readers can respond to . This is an interestingly eclectic argument which recalls Gadamer on the fusion of horizons ( the reader 's and the text 's ) , Marcuse on the utopian possibilities of high culture , and Sartre on the necessarily progressive implications of major literature . Ryan represents a kind of Marxism that non - Marxists might do business with , in the sense that one can make a rational engagement with it .	127

If the desired shade is obtained with one coat of varnish stain , then further protection should be given with extra coats of clear gloss , satin or matt varnish .

This also appears to be an attraction to members of British police forces . Holdaway ( 1983 : 72 ) [noted] how lawyers were seen by Hilton 's police as a threat because they unmask police practice , and , along with doctors and social workers , they were considered challengers . This led some policemen to enjoy the sport which the court room offered ( Holdaway 1983 : 74 ) . In the case of policemen at Easton , this sport is situationally constrained by the common - sense knowledge they build up of the court room setting and its players .	62

Again , they operate with similar typifications of who constitute the troublesome clients , based partly on experience but also heavily influenced by stereotypes of the educationally subnormal , one - parent families , families in whom historically crime runs , and so on . As Furlong [noted] with respect to teachers ( 1977 : 163 ) , their typifications of problem pupils were also heavily conditioned by specialist sociological knowledge ( from socially deprived families ) or common - sense notions of psychoanalysis ( never had a father ) . These stereotypes can become deployed to explain persistent offending among the young even when there is little evidence that they are appropriate . Backgrounds can therefore be reconstructed for the problem child in which their persistent offending becomes understandable .	59

Robinson ( 1972 ) found that , in America , the knowledge gap was greater amongst those who relied on the press and smaller amongst those who relied upon television .

In January 1922 the town Party committee observed that there was no anti - Bolshevik agitation amongst the local clergy , the main focus of possible rural discontent . It was [noted] however that what was contemptuously called the village intelligentsia still maintained a hostile attitude to the Party and the Red Army . At the end of February news filtered in that no peasants were willing to join the military ranks , and there were quite a few desertions . The greater part of the required prodnalog ( tax in kind ) had been collected , but several villages were fractious due to silly actions by some officials .	59

This depleted the famine areas further , and sparked off new hatred amongst the peasants . In the subsequent scramble for survival and enrichment which mounted towards the end of 1922 , it was not surprising that those who were slightly better off often took a kind of revenge in driving hard bargains with their poorer neighbours , as has been [noted] earlier . The intermediary between local bodies and Moscow were the guberniia Commissions for the Relief of the Starving . The Tsaritsyn Commission was set up on 8 August 192 1 , and like its counterparts in other gubernii , were very closely modelled on Pomgol , the all - Russian organ in Moscow .	91

Further , he was not unwilling to show enterprise . The move towards cash limits , cuts in current expenditure , and a generally monetarist policy were heralded by a speech to the TUC in September 1976 , which ( as [noted] ) reflected the influence of his son - in - law , Peter Jay . Again , on education , Callaghan attempted to promote new standards of literacy and numeracy , based on an agreed core curriculum in schools . In foreign policy , while seldom innovative , he did try to carve out new relationships with Britain 's new European partners , especially through his close personal association with Helmut Schmidt , the West German chancellor and a fellow social democrat , as well as maintaining his contacts with the new US Democratic administration of Jimmy Carter .	54

The Scottish and Welsh Devolution Bills made steady progress through the Commons , until both became law in 1978 . But there was much evidence of divided counsels on both the Labour and Conservative sides , as has been [noted] above . Indeed , the government had to make major concessions during the committee stage , especially to Labour critics . The amendment by an expatriate Scot , George Cunningham ( Labour , Islington ) , by ensuring that a 40 per cent vote of the electorate ( not simply of those voting ) would have to be achieved for a devolution bill to go through and for a repeal order not to be tabled , made devolution , at least for Wales , virtually an impossibility .	57

The government 's reaction pivoted on the response of the Prime Minister , James Callaghan . As [noted] , his prestige had steadily risen since his accession to office . In particular , as an old union man he was thought to have a particularly sensitive , almost intuitive , understanding of the unions and how best to sell a policy of wage restraint to them .

It lay rather in the company it kept , the classes with which it was associated . As [noted] , Mrs Thatcher came from a relatively humble , unprivileged background , though a degree at Oxford and later marriage to a millionaire businessman gave her a distinctly haut bourgeois status in time . But her outlook was subtly different , say from that of Edward Heath , whose father was a carpenter in a small town in Kent and who , like Mrs Thatcher , went to a local grammar school rather than the private boarding schools favoured by most Tory leaders .

There were factors at play in the association of theatrical cross - dressing and sexual transgressions . Not only did prostitutes frequent the theatre , but the street transvestite was sometimes associated with prostitution and possibly sodomy : Henriques [notes] a regulation dating from 1480 forbidding prostitutes to dress as men in public , and remarks : This masquerading presumably would have meant an added inducement to sodomy ( Prostitution and Society , ii . 88 ) .

Some redistribution had occurred between 1938 and 1949 , but if one ignores the top 1 per cent of income earners , there had been little change up to 1979 . Under the Conservative government , as [noted] , the tax system became less progressive , with the major reductions being made at the top end of the tax range and there were increases in national insurance and the nonprogressive indirect taxes . The tax cuts for the top income earners , the increase in share prices over the decade , and the effects of the recession have sharpened economic differentials in the Thatcher period . Although the Commission was dissolved in 1979 , the 1985 volume of Inland Revenue Annual Statistics found that between 1979 and 1983 the most wealthy 50 per cent of the adult population increased its share of total marketable wealth from 79 83 per cent to 80 4 per cent .	68

She chairs two of the most important ad hoc Cabinet committees , OD , dealing with foreign affairs and Northern Ireland , and EA , covering economic strategy , privatization , trade union legislation , and the European Community matters . The reduction in the number of Cabinet meetings ( 45 50 per annum , about half of the post - war norm ) , and of Cabinet papers ( 60 70 , or one - sixth of the figure in the 1950s ) , and the appointment of fewer Cabinet committees have reduced the opportunities for collective deliberation .	65

Aware of American dislike of centralized control , he confined his remarks to generalities about open trade welding nations together for mutual benefit . As [noted] above , Pan American Airways and its chairman , Juan Trippe , had the ear of Congress and president Roosevelt , and fed fears of British dominance in the air . It is quite true that the Americans were at least as worried about the British as the British were about them , but for very different reasons . The Americans were intimidated by the possible British routes allowed by Commonwealth and Empire airfields the world over .	48
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	These stages were based on productive technology . For example , hunters and gatherers were placed low while irrigating cultivators were placed high , then these activities were linked directly with such institutions as rules concerning property , the status of women , the type of government , and the kinship system . In this , Ancient Society resembled the other evolutionary schemes for the history of mankind which we have just [noted] . However , Ancient Society also differed from earlier work because of the high quality of the scholarly work on which it was based , because of the sympathy of the writer for primitives , and because it not only defined stages but in many cases suggested mechanisms which explained why one stage should change to another . This last element , perhaps more than any other , is crucial for understanding why Marx and Engels attached so much more importance to the work of Morgan than they did to the work of the other evolutionist anthropologists whom they read .	72
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	Anthropology and the work of Morgan were harnessed to the political task of rewriting history . There was another political task to which anthropology was put in the work of Marx , and for this the writings of Morgan also proved particularly appropriate . The use of anthropology which we have already [noted] can be called historical . Marx and Engels were interested in primitive cultures because they wanted to construct a general history and theory of society in order to explain the coming to be of capitalism . The second way in which they use anthropological material we can call rhetorical .	52
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	According to the theory , the people who used such a system of terms did not themselves , however , practise such a type of marriage but actually practices the next stage . This was because according to Morgan kin terms lag behind . As a result , the evidence for this second stage in the history of marriage depends entirely on the two assumptions which we have already [noted] . One that patterns of kin terms indicate types of marriage , and second , that the presence of such a pattern is a guide to a previous state of affairs . The Polynesians , according to this way of seeing things , had a system of kinship terms , which indicated , not the marriage system which they practised , but the marriage system which they had practised in the past .	69
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	Engels re - echoes The German Ideology in showing that far from the State being the repository of justice , it is the repository of exploitation , but here he does this by use of genuine anthropological materials . According to Engels the State only develops with the full elaboration of classes , and it is the tool of the ruling class enforcing its will on those whom it oppresses . This is a crucial proposition which we have already [noted] and which will be discussed again later in this book . It is by means of this idea that the State is linked with the earlier part of the origin of kinship and marriage . Classes and private property grow out of the family and together these various factors lead to the break - up of the gens .	80
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	Admittedly if the component family abandons its claim to the land this will revert to the commonality but that does not mean that there are no such claims in normal circumstances . In other words , a declaration of common ownership of the land of the gens does not imply free and equal access to all within the gens . Marx , in particular , had already [noted] this fact in several places , but he explained the phenomenon of internal division as a transitional one ; as evidence of a stage in which private property and individual families were coming in and undermining the communal descent group . A problem with this point of view is that there is in fact no evidence of descent groups having ever existed without these two levels and it seems difficult to treat all documented cases as transitions from a stage for which there is no evidence . In any case , the contradiction which Marx stresses very largely disappears when we realize that it is a matter of the context in which claim to land is expressed .	67
note.v	*2822013	to mention; remark. 'She noted that she liked the wallpaper'.	metaphorical	0.5757808499743984	Finally , since there is no simple correlation between high status for women and matriliny and since there is no simple connection between matriliny and type of technology , it follows that there is no simple connection between primitive technology and high status for women . Among living hunters and gatherers , women may have a comparatively high status as amongst the Mbuti of Africa , or a comparatively low status among most Australian Aborigines The issue is far more complicated and it is only fair to [note] that we have not reached a stage of knowledge when we can easily say what explains the status of women among the different peoples of the world . The status of women has several aspects which themselves do not go simple together . By and large the evidence which Engels and his contemporaries saw as significant of the high status of women in primitive societies is often wrong or does not signify what it was believed to mean .	87

These include delamination of wrought iron which arises with corrosion , owed to the presence of slag in the material between layers of almost pure iron . Also , it should be [noted] that there were no satisfactory ways of forming structural connections in cast iron by any processes such as welding , brazing or soldering . If such techniques appear to have been used , the structure should be regarded as suspect , because all reputable Victorian engineers were aware of the risks of making connections by these methods . Where these is no need for a retained iron structure to accept enlarged loads and it is apparent that the metal members are in food condition , not having been subjected to detrimental modifications , the chief consideration in re - using the installation is to achieve an acceptable standard of fire resistance .	42

On a mixed farm , there would be a larger number of buildings for cattle , while on a pastoral farm the reduced need for waggon horses caused the stables to be small and there would be little accommodation for crops . It is interesting to [note] that sheep had almost no effect on the form of the farmstead as buildings were very rarely provided for them . Where land was readily acquired so that the farmstead could be enlarged in a logical way , rather than the haphazard development which resulted from the erection of buildings on whatever sites became available , individual buildings within the grouping were sited so as to maximise efficiency . Threshed straw had to be taken from the barns to the cattle or the horses for use as feed or litter .	84

Inevitably , I [noted] these criticisms were rarely in relation to what he had said ( few had actually read the book ) , but rather were expressions of shocked outrage that he had failed to keep silent and say nothing at all . Indeed , the fact that he had apparently used an editor from a Manchester newspaper for some of his purposes was latched onto and quoted as a sign that he was suspect and disloyal .

The invisibility in the written record , which Shapland and Hobbs ( 1989 ) observed , and the unrecorded information which Chatterton told the conference remained hidden in the heads of the constables are the result of cultural values , which are then brought to bear to deny validity to these agendas . It is worth [noting] the language in the Federation rebuttal of the PSI report , for it illustrates how the culture is programmed to sneer at the graphic literary phrase and dismiss the use of anecdotal material as unscientific : while participant observation is considered to be a world away from research based on safe academic principles ( my emphasis ) .

His aim in this was as far as possible to translate changes of tones into changes of colour , feeling that only by this method could the full saturation and pressure of colour be realized .

If anything , the return of the land to the practising farmers by the land Acts would have strengthened such a morality . It is also interesting to [note] that the issue of land inheritance was a key reason why the Irish population voted no in the referendum on divorce in 1986 .

Having a resistivity of some 10M and a permittivity of 3 , it would remain the first choice of insulation for undersea cables until development of para gutta , composed of wax and deproteinised rubber . This too would retain its pre - eminent position as an insulator until replaced around 1933 by Polyethylene developed by ICI .	50

It could be anticipated that the college would have seen the creation of a continuous stream of books and papers generated by the rich [source] of material which pours through its gates , but this has hardly been the case .

Novels have been a rich [source] of material for the film industry since the talkies were introduced , and it 's very interesting to see how both classic and contemporary novels require skilled adaptation of the dialogue to make sufficient dramatic impact in a film . As you read you will probably be aware of a character 's potential as a role for the actor particularly with those who have already an established place in theatrical tradition ( Dickens is full of such characters ) .

The first unarguable influence on Agatha Christie 's writings can be found in one of the Digressions in Beowulf .

There is no need to be intimidated by the formality of a staid institution 's catalogue , or to neglect popular magazines ; as for writing in various academic disciplines , there ought to be no barrier to learning about an interesting topic .

A final caution about using monographs about painters is that they can seldom be read alone . Historical background is only compressed in a monograph ; biographical material may be more extensive in other [sources] ; the painter 's contemporaries will not receive much attention , and may be slighted . Even illustrations may not be adequate , details of pictures often being poorly represented , leaving an artist 's techniques , materials and handling to be discovered from more specialist studies . The reader can hope , all the same , that the writer will give an account of the special merits of key pictures , and it is these art critical passages which can be of most help in enjoying or appreciating the chosen artist 's achievement .	50

We also tested a sample of autistic children in the chocolate - finding task and found that they were again behaving just like the three - year - olds : going to the baited box for twenty trials , despite wanting to [win] chocolates and occasionally trying to filch them from the experimenter 's bag . This suggests the hypothesis that one of the features of autism is a lack of central control of thinking similar to that found in very young normal children . Their input systems function adequately , but their thinking lacks the full , holistic character of normal thought .	111

I certainly would not want to attempt a summary of the route we have taken all the way from the mind - body problem to children trying to [win] chocolates ; but I do need to make some concluding comments to justify the bold claim in the first paragraph that constructivism makes the mind - body problem less intractable . I argued that the representational theory of mind , with its assumption that thinking is the possession of determinate mental states which are in some sense encodings ( pictorial , syntactic ) of actual or possible states of affairs , contributes to the difficulty of the mind - body problem . We have mainly been concerned with the modern computational version of the representational theory of mind ; but , as I shall mention again later , the more traditional views of mental life are no less representational phenomenology , for example , is a representational theory of mind .	59

But was she trying to confuse the plot by saying : I know that it is impossible for me to [win] four Grand Slam tournaments this year . Some burning sun , black clouds , rain and wind were the backdrop to another highly agreeable fortnight in Paris at just about the perfect time of year .

Each male team must field at least three competitors and each female team , two . In this way , short - handed teams still have a chance to [win] and the match is therefore meaningful . A successful team may have to go through a number of fights during the course of a day 's competition so it is not at all unusual to see teams short - handed through injury in the final stages .
