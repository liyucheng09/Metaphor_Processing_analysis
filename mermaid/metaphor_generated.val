Best of painters ! make portray
Where lie sprawled. .
When howe was retreating , he made him pursue ;
Those fallen woods , that shine with bloom ,
The world escaping ? magnus ' fortunes stood ,
Sweet is the page that spreads there ,
Down came a bishop , sirs , and up
In this sudden terror struck .
Tho ' never mirth wrings a strain
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes ,
The which i mai noght yit see .
While sleep brings man and beast to her .
Since from blood let out rise only ghosts again ,
Nor turn them up to pray .
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
Tortured her love not to yield the law .
White wings beat on the white .
So that a discord arose among things
Back they flew , and reached their nest .
With nothing but blank sky and wounds that ache ,
And feebly bathed in his son 's warm gore .
Must greet a soul that ached for her
Aye , we will follow the flag
Thereat the warrior went , and strange it seemed
He sprang to the twelve ; for at his head
A few brief questions ; and the answers came
On our threshold a welcome still remains .
But counts several figures in its cost ;
Where clover-blossoms spread their fragrance wide
All space would ring and ring with my rhyme .
Which , hearing rescued israel , sprang erect ,
When mary stay 'd beneath . but not to deal
Bluster or cringe , and find life
And share what fell of beds and crumbs ,
By medicine well wrought , but without grace
And nails as keys follow thee everywhere .
To marriage state he turns his thoughts anew ,
And in her old bounds buried her despair ,
By it your fathers stood unmoved and true ,
Of tissue gather around him , shutting out
Though from it inspiration came .
And the structure , as it rose ,
If prudent , age should lead the friendly foe ,
So she set it to boil ,
Love still shall twine around its brim .
Because i give an impious gift to thee --
" a weeping country joins a widow 's tear ;
For to church it never went .
But leave much lasting bloom .
And chanting left the wood-nymph ,
Your judgment forms a guilty poem , there
Still with his soul severe account he kept ,
Which since runs coursing as doth thy blood ;
The need that men feel to create and believe ,
Yet i bear a heart shall support me still .
He made address to her , and she
When the gloaming fell that night ,
And fortune , has an awkward part to play ;
Subdued her strength nor shrinking at her charms --
The coward slave who tosses aside ;
And trace the eternal meanings .
We will take the cannon back
On the crops the white-frost settled ,
Or souls that their eternal rest do find ,
The tawny covering from the dark wolf fled ;
The winds blow warm as araby :
Appointed at approaching times his solemn feasts ,
Her ambushed violets hide .
How the winters are falling like flakes of snow !
Like a grimme lyon drove with fierce might
Well arrange the dances . the
Sinner and saint it makes them all ,
I seemed to move among a world of ghosts ;
And with frost was quite subdued ,
The wind that comes from the frozen hill .
Sad sat aeneas , pitying their estate ,
And watch the sun go down behind the trees ,
But that a pure and christian faith grew warm ,
Rags ! and our only requiem given ,
What verse can sing , what prose narrate ,
Perpetual , which nor autumn leave dispers 'd
Or by fate 's malice to destruction brought ,
" let galileo take his own opinions .
Her strong hand rested on her blunted sword ,
Soon sank the sea-mist ,
And lose in love , and friendship 's smile
Could make no answer to her glorious eyes :
That door could lead to hell ?
These cares alone her virgin breast inspire ,
So there the thing stands . "
He made demand ; and in the stranger knew
The tryst is come for me ,
My bones at quiet may go take their rest ;
Were blameless , or lost . for innocence
At his touch he felt new courage
Now waned all the power of stifled birth
That heals and save ."
Yes , go and carry comfort to thy friends ,
By vain prosperity led , the
 death is standing at the door .
In forfeit kisses passed from lip to lip .
" let power stand as sentry on every hand ,
And every joy he brings me comes
Constantia threw a serious fit --
The proclamation made for may :
By contrast make it bright :
What needs he the defence this arm can make ?
For while her limbs were lying in deadly sleep
A master passed in mastership ,
The hosts made way for passage of the king ,
But beauty 's only born for love .
Would fall like resurrection on the mind ,
They also tell of misadventure sad
Of elm trees , newly sprang into bud ,
The fibre goes , and through the vital parts
Of rome , enslaved , is torn into life ;
The attending heralds , as by office bound ,
To keep the hunt until the quarry 's won .
Thus stood they congee , and the angry knight
So few are now the feet that bear ;
Here they lay , had realms and lands ,
To lift a bloom up to the sun
The appetite remains , that this is ask 'd ,
Nor the bird of air did follow him .
My soul comes clad in gorgeous things ,
When him a melancholy voice directed ;
That manhood 's powers employ ,
And clouds are swept , and banks stretch wide ,
Of lively portraiture displayed ,
What do i feel that am myself undone ?
Jan goes on from bad to worse ,
Ha balancing o'er the cloud of saxon war ,
Their music never rests . the
Till it touched thetop of heaven ,
Whom nature hath made apt for every change !
And hands to make his hands rejoice ,
What horror was wrought in that small hot bird .
With asses all his time he spent ,
" and then the doom foreseen upon me came ,
“ dismiss , quell thine idle fear ,
Two strangers haste to join his train .
That jupiter supreme still holds the throne .
Macerate came on the paladins and ladies all .
Thy world and mine , the eternal victory keep !
To pass delay not , moved by blows behind ;
Nor with the scoffers join :
How supplejoints a lesson heard
And , better far , a heart that feels
That made him careless ' mid his dead ,
In stars , she pointed to america , the land
And gild our chamber ceilings as they shine ,
In that lake of tears which my grief contains ,
This he had held above all others dear ;
“ while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece
Within the gates his way he took ;
And weariness was replaced with delight ,
And been by gryphon foully turned to scorn ;
And its perplexed paths no more can lead ;
Great merion follows , and new shouts arise :
Junctions hide some separate truth that we may know .
For { books apply to husbands and to brothers .
But this comes from the bless 'd abodes ,
The curtain draws o ' nature 's rest ,
And take the harmless folly of the time !
Who found i ween two hundred years ,
- the few steps taken at a funeral pace
I give to thee the mode of dying , "
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
Which , whirling round , ran on so rapidly ,
To him i bring my fear ,
Princess , give ear to this my summary ;
My youth and joy consume .
Who made through cowardice the great refusal .
Gold bands his raised hoof presents ,
Till each rivet feels the strain ,
Shouldst not tear my veins asunder . "
Lock 'd rotting rooms her eyes must never pass ,
But human nature teaches . .
But how arose the meaning of the signs ?
To adam what shall come in future dayes ,
But all abstracts of rarities are lost ,
And driven the harpies from their native reign ?
On the morrow stood to challenge ; in their strength
The finest organ , and shaped by mind .
And my poor words are lost amid that throng ,
Of his ally took vengeance , destroying perchance
And the rifles sang their hate ,
Host against host with shadowy squadrons blending ,
And within it came a people
And cold the wind that wanders round
That leaves me alone in the strife ,
Latona gave thy life to thee ,
"" ring out the thousand wars of old ,
Shall melt the snaws of age ;
And it brings the sleet and the snow .
Gliding on , cried sanctimonius ,
But still one task remains to do ;
She never moved . no word , no motion ,
And took them to his warrior train in charge .
The chanting pythoness shines oracle ,
" i should curse the hour that brings me ,
There 's never a scot shall set ye free :
In other days ere joy had filled this brow ;
We leave the name that marks our race ;
Whether need of gold should assail thee ,
Where liberty shall firmly stand ,
A bird of prey , with talons reeking ,
We scarce could do better than make an alliance ,
One lays the mango garden low ,
And though her tresses lay but in such guise
To shed their tears around his tomb .
His will knew control ; and long fettered desire
In streets where stood their rosy stalls ,
And all his vengeance get .
The bugle 's gone for smoke and play ;
Hence comes the indian-summer bloom
And to suggest one counsel they take .
The first said : " i have found a king
To lift that mortgage , to pay that debt .
Which draws the holiest from the people 's eyes
It lies to me and a man i know ,
But naught of our flag can change .
To watch the clouds go drifting by ?
Lest , thus armed with funereal gloom ,
Whilst on each face the embers fall ,
L take care that in our members life remains .
Which by kind sorrow 's ministry hath taken
To whom dominion o'er the rest belongs .
There rests his veilèd destiny ;
Nor , till the sun had gone to bed ,
And those mute lips to smiles had turned ;
They set the old echoes calling :
The marsh-grass trailed with the flowers ,
On the sleeper 's ear those rich notes resound ,
Sapped by corruption to itself suffused .
Through the thought still spread beyond her :
Shall find one word , to tell
In public loss to shed a tear ,
Mercy soon rose her to praise above .
I see my coming has but mischief made .
And whoever it follow 'd was made clean !
And conscience , truth , and honesty are found
Of weary fibres strung with toil ,
Should be made better for the life of man --
And with his words new rapture came :
They brought us battle , through our leader 's fault
Content , thine equal , held in faithful peace ,
I felt no fear ; the one who waited there
Many dreary days have wandered ,
Nor envy find a place .
The old man , sunk and propless quite .
Screeched out a song , to drown my grief ;
And there the body lies , age after age .
That i shall raise no mournful cry :
A king might wish to hold in fee .
With truth i answer ; thou the truth contain .
Was strengthened in the hate she bore before .
Approaching fights , and fields to bathe in blood .
But nature renders it imperfect ever ,
Such order dealt huge ajax ; purple gore
Before the last rose , heavy with dew ,
" unhappy guest ! whose sorrows press my mind !
Who give fresh beauty to the morning light ,
With the cud that made it swell .
Up the street came the rebel tread ,
As golden balls with laughter lightly flutter ,
While my life and taste expand ,
And heard the curled waves of the harbor moan .
To make the scene more fair ;
Your friend is dead , " i added .
( a gray east , veined with rosy day )
Hast rendered me security , and drawn me
And summer comes wi ' joy ,
A wife gives or takes love in upright earnest .
To veil the sob of my agony .
Does it come that i love again ?
A rushing dream of dread , upon the deep ;
The devil takes sweet shapes when he tells lies .
And the drums strike more convulsive ,
Oh , give me death or liberty !
The nymph gives breath to shake and thrill ;
" it will not go for nought . "
The feather 'd arrow brought a dire portent ,
I laughed to set them aching ,
Might raise musaeus from his bower ,
To read its genius , and direct its rage .
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
The warly race may riches bring ,
L lead thy footsteps to the realms below --
With years and spheres that pass ,
With boughs that snap at every breath ,
Then shall the church in rapturous numbers rise ,
The western republic will make it through -- :
The father , so far removed as to humor
But little time had spent her drooping head ,
Victorious he his mighty triumph holds ,
She felt reluctant to the deep , such dread
With pity moved , exhorted mercury
Thy tears and all thy songs to blend .
With thee , and then it waxed alert ,
A glory i shall not see .
What sleight had she the wardens to assume ?
With transports hung upon pain ,
Save of blown self-applause , they proudly stood
And make that bright revealment known
Janeteenth comes upon my lowly grave ,
From out the ashes sprung .
A death he once had found most fair ;
Wee must that discord surely find ,
In life ’s best joys my share have shone ;
Big ships with sails opened to the breeze ;
Two chiefs from each drew breathless to the plain .
Or generous Draft , offered as a gift ,
Are swept like sweet maidens when they dream .
And curled like serpents which prey .
And the more ample years go
Made filthy mixture , with steps coming slow ;
Is there no term of suffering set before thee ?
The sun had sunk the crab at morn
And put on his beard so gray .
From his pure fountains ran two streams likewise ,
When overcome 't is laid by the sea .
May bear some witness to my virtuous spring ,
And meekly took what fortune sent :
Where dionean caesar 's star shone forth
A flare went up ; the shining whiteness spread
Before me stands his spectral stand ,
And raising voice to tears ,
The fruits are set in eternity ,
Strong in a fate set free ,
Where not to vile fanatic passion turned ,
Whose snorting nostrils drank the flames of fire .
Thy war ( discreetly wrought ) with white success .
What could he see but mightily he noted ?
With courage made the sacrifice .
Nor seek of grace from fair ladye . "
Death and anguish follow ? " he cries , --
Wide the new world had found its bright gates .
Her white feet came glimmering
And life 's fine loyalties are turned to jest ,
Thus the golden moon made answer :
The parakeets run screaming by
My apprehensions come in crowds ;
And all the trembling flowers they hold .
Her forming hand gave shape unto the name .
Death will quickly come upon me ,
With brimming glass that holds the toast ,
While ilion like a mist rose into towers .
For their amusements never wafted ,
His wheels settles -- what shall men find then ?
 one lonely day — another came in sadness ;
No music that the robin made
Now mingling with incense from diana 's shrine ,
With music made of distraction his heart enlarged .
Our perfect union would be made complete :
Jan returning moons and planets to their constant road
Are reached the hearts of all the ranging seas --
To follow a sovereign and relieve a sire :
Few steps we took until we there had come ,
He freed his soul from sin 's dark trace ,
That the long years passed in the outs and ins
" whilst thou slept , i took to musing
Who run through the centuries his race .
Yet faithful to its trust remaining .
Halting out their futile tune ,
From my weak heart the falling emptiness .
And whispering fear has taken instead .
And his health goes briskly all day round .
Where the dusky warp we trace , --
The little gate was unlocked at last ,
Britain , aspiring briton , now must answer --
How comes that lovely casket here to me ?
That takes and re-delivers every stroke
And i ne'er knew what music sang ,
Fame starts trembling at such prizes won ,
Of the shining courts of law ;
So rollant fell his sword was taken forth ,
Wherein a firebrand cast a dreadful light ,
She shall run upon your errands ,
And came to fancy all her youthful mind .
Soft on thee falls the breath of time ,
To make them look so gay ?
And give the seasons chase ,
Are rare . with this distinction take my words ;
Spoke aloud the words which follow :
The dear , brown eyes their answer made ;
Gives hope and fervor , nearer draws his theme
The essence that alone makes love divine --
My most true mind thus declares mine untrue .
And feeling such piercing pain they ca n't hold out
Trembling for ire , and making pale for rage ,
Thus , while in equal scales their fortune lay
Through the vast assembly passed .
But virtue hath perform 'd all change to grace :
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
May find as dear a nurse at need ,
He crushed remorse and crushed down despair :
She gave surrender to abducting arms .
Eurytion to his brother gave a prayer ,
Hard battle for us , pitched with arms
Their superstitions made them ready prey ;
More black than bright , bared death
I felt myself a ghost , and seemed to be
Thy ray could pierce , and answer have .
With the blight of death it spreads ?
By whose lost craft his mother died :
Since sorrows depart ; the
The torrent 's thundering died into a sigh ;
We spread the grass on that youngling spring ;
For , is this emmy that i see ?
Losing such a voluble answer promising all ,
Of matter , from their old arrangements made
Never was blast from vapour charged with cold ,
Who fought right , and kept his people free ;
Nor beam the argive story of ilium ,
On duties well performed , and days well spent !
But here is nought with grief to share .
His great mare made the hoof-casts fly .
Through all my pulses leap ;
Opinions ? they still hold a wider range :
Not worlds could keep her from his arms away ,
Thieves seize upon them furiously ,
Where bargains meet for purses spare ,
Where genius all his light discovers --
Must join the north and south in every good ,
When trembling night-winds whistle
That by their own gay light were lighted up .
In the holy temple made her amends ,
What stealthy footstep fills her ?
Who fills with fear the rending earth survey
Earthquake hath woven deeply its tale on them --
But i jumped to find how sharp had been
Who holds o'er all my faculties control
He lay before the rising sun ,
The number made the motion slower .
How have the raptur 'd moments flown !
The talk about the wondrous circus goes .
And truth prevailed , and righted wrong ,
While joy brings clouds the light of stars ,
With wicker arks did come
And following in my footsteps , hail new worlds ,
And wondered when i made reply ,
So the figures of this song proceed --
I reckon twenty years , ochone !
Who ever finds his loved ones ’ bliss .
The cold dust shall inform , and hide
Friend , who leap forth at our side ,
To joy and ease their days they spend ,
The kite went up . his honest heart
We loaf where the wind-spilled fountain flows .
The brightest truths that man has ever found .
A spell which thou , hast broken ,
Jumps into virtue thus by self-defence ,
Gives us a sense of the awe ,
Had leaned , and caught a soft impress .
Rich in each charm that feeds desire ,
No wing material fits our mortal clay .
And her eyes brimmed with tears ;
Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal ,
Macerate the sacred lodge with terror ,
And the rough hazels climb along the beach .
Back through the streets that rise at your tread --
The fruitful bough they reach .
Laid ' neath your careless tread .
The warrior 's gyves no sooner they reach ,
It clasped her neck and fell asleep .
The message given was for the king design 'd .
A rose whose crimson breath rises
As hope was rising in his breast :
Like the great sun who fills the skies ,
How the allotted income came ,
Janitors find simpler than the reckoning of their shilling .
Here appeared the chronicles that told
An angel sends from every cloud that rolls ;
Mind remained silent . i pressed for an answer .
That saw his royal standard laid on ground ,
And the moon never stares but it gives me nightmares
That better time , for which the patriots yearn ,
And brilliant treasure it may hold .
And in thy joyous errand reach the spot
A hermit ’s home should ever feel .
Honour , be sure , and duty strongly pressed :
Strike ! with every blow is given
And set beyond the brink of sense ,
Seem to pierce the wintry sky ,
Then a long silence fell upon the hall ,
The warmth of lips that make your own ,
Whereas it is noah , commanding the ark .
Could melt the smile of jean .
The bath preparing for her lord ’s return
So that from me the shadow reached the rock ,
And union find in freedom ?
Through love to strengthen in our souls the more .
The fate of a nation was riding that night .
And well his mighty puissance wrought ,
The clock struck one ,.
" this foolish tear will light my fire ,
And i must bear my cross on me
He made no effort to outlive his land ;
That with their weight they make the balances
Huging faith , a knight that hath to name
And finds the heart in love with night .
The boyish old man whom no fate ever seeks ;
But just the wine came drop and drip ;
Should be that eastern star for guidance seen ,
Lo , at last have found our way .
" from the bears ' mouths foam was shed ,
Up and down whirled youth in mountain ,
Janiced resentment at the outrage .
Which served for that titanic strife .
It passed to royal-erect ;
And the dire passage down to hell prepare .
Should join the melancholy chorus ; they
Which having passed and left him small treasure ,
The cold spring fills its hollow ;
This consciousness must riseth ,
Voice after voice caught up the song ,
He is kind , and comfort find
Pleasures bring , if sorrows follow :
While the red logs before us lay
What pain could get between my face and hers ?
Of holy dreams which come to us at night ,
Ah , woe to women death passes o'er !
It trembled to my touch . some careless hand
His beating bosom claim ’d the rising fight .
Many and beautiful stood those around ,
Nuclear spouse possessed such affection , whom she held so dear ,
A slender streak of blood showed how near
Herself placed as jove 's glorious child !
The weapons poised and reserves and withdrew .
And tears are shed . and
Their faith and love to show ,
Transfus 'd on thee his ample spirit rests .
Again it brings the fatal weight below ,
Hope lies nestling at her heart ,
Affection sound , and human passions quell .
And bring its changes as they come ,
Lifting my heart with blissful tears .
Those beautiful eyes still caress me .
All his the heart no sorrow knew ,
O monarch , in thy son we find .
Nor heave the home with grim affairs ;
Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone .
Daily round its flowers the wild bees swing .
They leave us so to the way we went ,
Jack knows what comes gain or loss ;
You and i have found the joy had birth
And weave , and task thy maidens . war waits
Will never give us cause for shame ,
Earth summoned up courage to her mighty heart ,
What joy sufficient hath november felt ,
The twilight hath stole over it , and left
Nor hold her sacred to the shades below .
And he spoke the words which follow :
When terror raised the living from the dead , --
Each day his soul rises up in prayer
In him the daily traits were found
The sword of gideon , and of god reveal .
The ring the false enchantment sought to clear .
West india dock may some time endure a drought ;
Your conscience , feeling cursed all the day .
But as in peace we tread love 's land ,
A century after this 't was made ,
Or only a sorrow left over from life ,
What sums from these old spouses i could take ,
Straight to the mayor he took his way :
An old romance to make young lovers weep .
As heaven had spent all perfumes there .
His banner and shield shall stand .
The foaming coursers to the stalls they point ;
On tuesday an address was made ;
The ms. adds this couplet :
Now trebly thundering came the gale
Beseems the wrath that saith the vow ,
The tears i shed must ever fall ,
And then a pensive sigh he drew ,
Gl made havoc of our life and powers ,
And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
And heal with freedom what your slavery cursed .
That stirs in every heart i find
He wept to follow the course he ran --
That steadfast , mournful strain , consoled
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
There lies not any troublous thing before ,
The waters wild went o'er his child ,
He tried to get a throw ;
To thee i make my prayer .
A smell of cooking rose a gust of smoke .
All gave consent , and forth there rose no lack
His presence makes us happy ,
So ran in making up the main account :
The billows fierce that dash to and fro ,
The shorter days were slowly creeping round ,
To see what my black hen doth lay .
And , trembling , these submissive words address ’d :
In skill , the worm a lesson may read ;
Anthology is known to have been laid .
Here wrapped in ice , the apricot ,
Nor only bring them tidings hame ,
I battled with all the fires of fate ,
All our hopes and fears were swayed
And nothing with him stayed .
And raise his base on that one solid joy ,
Snow is gone that was the flowers ' bale .
She quakes and fears to meet his sight ;
Much more than i relate between us pass 'd :
To fill the swelling veins for thee , and now
Of our two lives together , make them ;
Beneath its roots i often thought treasure was hid :
Smiles came seldom , but childlike and simple ,
Till the name of frost was given
Against a coast where sapphire shines white ,
Inscrutably shines that light whereon they look --
That leads to seas of light .
But fear touched not idomeneus as fear
Is the hour not fixed 'd by fate ?
And if it were i have the truth shown .
Though led by wayward fortune here .
Who shall pierce to thy naked splendour ,
The lake becoming that still proclaims her name .
And bless the friendly hand that gives me bread .
L following from world to world intent i seek . "
I shall make beauty out of many things :
The magic plant thy curious hand extends ;
What do we find in these hearts of ours ?
That holds love 's captive in ,
And on soft smelling flowers drew him downe ,
When no force else can break the masterdom .
Ill luck still bestows a fairy grot .
Joy , and a little sorrow shalt not mix ?
Than poets ever found of yore ;
Like the caged bird escaping suddenly ,
For virtue meets a high reward ,
Each time to find new chances he has lost ?
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
When on falling love the blame is thrown .
My part in her is played . "
Let yourself fill ; and shadeful trees ,
Upon th ' immortal gods to vent his rage .
And the wretched council 's bosoms beat ,
He sought counsel with his dam ,
All other beasts that saw , with like desire
His hand the wise creator gave ;
These i withdrew from him , and passed his days
Everywhere night lies like a blue cloth .
No wonder disease should have seized up her liver ,
The hay-sweet heat that soaked the skies !
Locked from the arrogant equality of the rest ;
That will get him out of the way .
To mark each passing age .
To catch the foemen passing by
Within his arms encircled and sustained me ,
None shall stand in the way of the lord ,
Simply obedient to its guiding will ,
And all life 's warmth to stony coldness turned .
That parson went to sleep .
As the dancers twined in a waltz of strauss ;
You see , exactly , new year 's day ,
We 'll try to find some brighter side .
The beauties it learns through love .
No patriot voice thy glory shall see ,
Answered in the words that follow :
Cool airs are blowing that the night is near .
My heart runs o'er with sweet surmises ,
But the night shall be filled with nightmares ,
Such guerdon as belongs to their lot .
Law can discover sin , but not remove ,
Love not , it may breed the sorrow ,
He laughed , and something glad within me stirred .
Lacking the silence -- facing the prospect
From the white part come the moonbeams ,
That grieved and doubted , it came to pass
By bitter waters , held by those who feigned
But as lamenting will not raise the dead ,
One gem to hold as most supremely fair ,
Whom late the nation he had led ,
And close inspection will see how tattered
They never grieve at all for sands that run ,
And slowly fading , drifts the life away .
His presence brings all admetus ' bliss ,
Malignant fate sat by and watched --
To win their fête champêtre .
So christian warriors bore the sin of strife , --
Or all enjoying , what contentment find ?
Macerate the whole church to overthrow !
Then just to catch a rap from burke ,
Whence scholars , statesmen , bards have fallen ,
The question arises , was arthur mold
And many deaths do they bring by this :
Peace that knows not crime nor sin .
For few the horses which that region owns ;
Who spread with foliage the great hills , and rear
To make acquaintance with his lands ;
Why , even death stands still ,
All hearts are stirred and softened at her name ,
Cold , cold , this heart must go ,
Who journey thither find themselves alone
Jan make slow pursuit , or altogether balk
Grievous sufferings waited upon her ,
Supine on earth an awful figure lies ,
And leave us nothing to believe in , worth
Love is enough : ho ye who goest saving ,
The north , came rushing on the wind ,
In worship man hath made ;
The years that through my portals come and go .
That night the wind came from the north ,
I took her dainty eyes as well .
But no -- earth still sees her smile ;
' t is he that gives us value .
Now has lost its hundred branches ,
Till the sun and moon changed places ,
Out of your rhymes and leave your dream .
And a sound of music waxed sweet
I know not , and its lucid orb fills .
' a power which comes and goes like dream ,
As when it mocks the blossoms of our spring .
And the salt sea it came in .
And each from each took heart of grace
Nought but griefs with me remain .
Thither the vanquisht hafed went
Which forms their daily bread .
By its own light the truth is shown ,
There came a sudden glimpse of spirit faces ,
_ extremes are fatal where they once do stand ,
Hath come for a solace to itself ,
A settled calm , that brings relief ,
Which tells what they think of the transgression :
Who enters here but makes the way more long
May a speedy reform more happy days succeed .
She caught the pity from my heart ,
Call all the loves to come nigh ;
On the seven sages turned their eager gaze , --
He turned his face to the stream below ,
Disease is sin , the book declares ;
Daring all the herd to follow .
Entering a temple of his sire that stood
The freedom i now find of asking .
Except the straggling green which hides the wood .
And the boughs held twenty-one ;
And beautiful had faded into the grave ,
Still more in one by promise given .
Ceased the birds , the wind loud answer came ,
That sea which floweth forth with swelling tides ,
They have melted away where the last dreams die ...
A bell was held folk to prayer :
With earnest supplication made ,
Our lives went on together until now .
There the sure suns of these pale shadows move ;
He did not know the inquisition came ,
Beyond the sob that stilled erinna 's voice .
Begone , and give me peace ,
To make the matter fully known all round .
Beneath whose light the shadow takes form .
I felt my soul within me reel and shake
Which showed that he did n't care one rap
The flowers wait the cricket season !
When they reached their foes the rout ,
Over my mood stealing and stealing they come ,
That same sweet rumour ran ,
The snow was falling , as if heaven drew down
And poured forth what their spirits felt ,
And tumbling in the troubled stream sought keep
And as it passes awakens leafy tunes :
Boldly and wild his music declares its star .
Among the opening clouds shall rise ,
And dark through paths oblique their progress made .
Now , foiled and shattered , it springs again
What came of her ? the bitter nights
That keeps time 's sleep thereunder
Death comes in a day or two .
What marriage means , thus pert replied :
In a wide world streaked with blue
Ye blow upon the sod that wraps my friend :
And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance .
As quick a growth to meet decay ,
Jack knows what comes gain or loss ;
Life is made of them ; and it seems wisdom
Our loves as flowers turn to dust ;
The breezes sadly growl .
That first gave peace to man .
Another said , while balancing sighs ,
Of heaven went spinning its own wilful way .
Glimpses i caught of faces that have come
But darkly hung the war around ,
Glancing in defiance , daisy fraser stood .
On desperat revenge , that shall redound
Ships move , running or bearing , and the poise
Thus all things lovingly put on ,
Golden , tipped with red , the blossoms glowing ;
" i wish that ye may feel for sin "
Whose judgment can discern , whose choice belong .
He points his guns , his colors stand ,
It speaks but cowardice .
On these bleak climes by fortune led ,
Jan gave his benediction and embrace ,
And ancient valour turned to cowardice .
And gleam by following gleam is spurred and urged .
And answer with reluctant tread :
The mighty pile of freedom lies .
For thee their snares the suitor lords shall tread
Shouldst thou it say of them
They 'll carry the burden of their guilt ,
Sit silent , while our days have passed away
Without regard , or due decorum shown ;
From which all heavenly virtues flow .
Lured by a tyrant 's iron sway ,
Into his soul , and give him power to cope
To that man my faith is clinging ,
Save to wait for the sign to come :
That would be perfect , fixed his mind .
Awakes to grief the reviv 'd mind ,
Iran , his dear-loved country , sat
Here warlike latins hold the happy lands .
And dying to destruction brought .
And those sunk eyes now turn to earth
The different doom our fates assign .
My soul with the deep shadows round thee spun ,
How all his malice aimed but to bring forth
Hyperspace reserved for wealthy men ,
Cold winter 's ice is fled and gone ,
Trusted the man , made surety doubly sure ,
Naught meets you there but the childlike , truthful ,
The trodden throne passed -- the saxon line
They pulled and hauled and orders took ,
Is wrought with such a witching art ,
To take th ' initiative of ruthless war ;
And drown his wasting moments out in tears .
Which surged into each _ reverend _ sire ,
Enormous arches , reaching beholders ; --
And every sail its various tribute pays :
It makes you wish that you might only live
Their eyes shall see the kingdom of the law ,
But when sir thomas turned to his devotions ,
We here mount to thy superior throne :
But wait till they melt into warm white snow !
It takes its proper place -- a masterpiece !
When the rain descends , decay decays it :
And the dew lay on the flowers ,
And made it public law , to burn ,
And through the dawning irids ambushed meanings stole .
Always came her wish to pray ;
She saw the tears his speech that fell ,
She came to fill 'd my soul with dread .
U showed how fair she was . her sweet voice rang
For turned he but his eye toward the plain
That he who reaches her beauty 's furthest goal ,
Then first the hero ’s manly breast knew fear .
Whose sweet pure touch just stirs the trees .
That brings me unto love , and such an one
Perverted and inventions lie thereon .
He feels the wounds of woe :
Always aspiring to be swept in tune
The red gate-towers flashed against the twilight ,
Night and day have made an everlasting bond
Of forest , swept and carpeted with glooms ,
And heaps of bodies hugged the level ground .
In their depths the passion laid
The pilgrim in its halls finds rest .
Peace would come out forevermore
Or any strong emotion linked with clay .
The giddy swallows took to flight ,
Knowing the soil that lay , so well ,
But the singer bore with his grief alone
With solemn echoing pealed their dwelling-place .
The white leaves flutter , one by one ,
But when winter months come ,
The trees their rain of blossoms pour
Then we shall go to sleep ,
While resting from the rapid beat
Then dwindled like her blossom ; june was gone .
The heart will seek its kindred heart ,
The wonder that my wit can not smother .
 death warm as life . ” then rose a cry
Great good treasure his knights have won in pound ,
Lining to the feast that 's now provided .
The love you bring , oh , baby dear ,
Right may be found or wrong . my latest prayer
The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud ,
His body , on whose eyes minerva fix 'd
And error stands with steadfast mind aloof .
To lift the frosty air , inform the day ;
And sorrow 's piercing dart .
Such odorous tribute paid the magdalene ;
But the cruel rocks they bind her sides
Nor felt a magnet 's sly seduction .
Mothers , they leave us , carrying seed ;
And frozen pearls are all the world can give ,
Time will come to part , love ,
And the fierce pain clutched me and rent me ;
Her feet disperse the powdery snow ,
That fed the artery . .
To meet thy gaze , and uttering graceful words
That sits eternal sadness on his brow ,
Of earthly ministers , tho ' their mouths be set
But yesterweek where the cloud waves rolled
E'er kept too fond an ear ;
Gave me to face the orient . nor our way
But when the fever leaves him and he feels
The white lake-blossom fell into the lake ,
Or mark the tide heaven pushes through our veins ,
Like the wee blink that shines in a tear .
Nor fits the time to send whole armies out ,
Foretold so lately what would come to pass ,
Guys put forth thy strength , and release ;
And she for them in heaven made intercession .
That can all crosses blessings bring ;
Not one but that its memory made him glad .
The warfare , now , th ' invaders pour
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell ,
The volleying thunder there hangs low ;
He fell with his hurt where a regiment fell ,
So has another paradise been lost .
And the target , bathed in blood ,
This night are filled with poignant gust ,
There to shape them into weapons ,
As it roared along the forest ,
My southern friend had got no brain .
The article takes the following forms :
On thee we cast each earthborn care ,
My soul meets all eyes but them , --
Her nervous hands in gestures half raised .
And sweet from where the land lies green ;
Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm .
She bore sarpedon of heroic note .
Drips the spring my boyhood knew .
That shaped her sorrow , rocks and pools ,
A world of burning remembrances
The bowl goes trim . the moon doth shine .
His flames from burning but to make them more :
This stone can tell the story of my life ,
He therefore followed , the poet wary ,
That was the greatest picture on any canvas drawn ;
And such fair truce replaced that discord fell ,
Warm presence of chaste beauty , had brought
The radiant moon above us held :
Then to automedon he gave command
And flashing swords draw rigid faces in the street .
That topmast-high the flashing waters spread .
All it dreamed when it stood
With this wild rose that all may see ? _
The armies fade , the lustre dies .
The silent joy that flows so deep ,
Contending in the games held at his tomb ,
To keep me happy all the day .
And to their imperial manhood raise the ashes from
Beneath thy blue canopy i have found shelter ,
And made her think of elfin lamps ,
Soft burst dark curls from pale temples --
' for here , forlorn and lost i feel ,
How all our copper had gone for his service !
Than any broken music thou canst make . '
He that sends the cruel winter ,
The lines of sorrow that lie drawn in me
If , chance , by lonely contemplation led ,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
And as the azure stream has rolled
Her heart shall own my laughter and my tears ,
Love has made itself the whole .
In every clime while army army lay ,
All that which afrike ever brought forth strange ,
Too blindly have reposed my trust :
The trojan fire still burns : pledge of the past
The river slips through its silent bed .
Of the great shield , wherein the lion lies
For all my wounds are lodged in my breast ,
In coward gloom immersed , or crushed despair .
To bring for very joy all hearts to tears
This goblet , stamped with curious art ,
The health of a day gone by , --
If one should cast consoling arms about ,
They go in whirls of light
That oft has made poor children weep ,
Round farmers ' chariot swept the slain ,
And hope and memory own a mingled joy .
Such suns in such a bed deserve to lie .
Her eyes were filled with sudden strange alarms ;
Our lakes and streams hold wealth untold ,
Some tears of misery she shed .
To make the terror sterner for the light .
Could make that strange enchantment live again ?
Then went , while earth on winter lay aghast ,
But boundless oceans , expiring wide ,
To-day , base warrior , shall thou stand
The soul disdainful of the caves of night ,
And every sparkle shivering to new blaze ,
Since your bright leaves first met the sun ,
Whence came the tearful gleam that then
{ 59 } objections stated and made .
Which daśaratha keeps in view .
The solid gate its fury scarcely breaks ;
Shall find his avarice there and cowardice ;
To that which never can us comfort find .
How many days have been idly spent ;
With my young heart filled with terror ;
A face that lifts up ; sweet face
Our faith and patience ; wherefore should we leap
Showing as darkness comes more and more
Horrid to think , how horrible to feel !
The venom of their hate is poured ;
Some through the grey air leapt in swift flight .
Et corporis sedes in secret was raised .
Not art but nature drew these lovely lines ,
Where the great wall round china goes ,
Longer , for remedy can none be found ;
It makes an awful racket ! "
Love gives his sign , and by no other road
Laying its fair emblems from mountain to shore ,
Of infamy ! fierce conflict hath arisen ;
Christ 's precious gift of wisdom bring .
From which some trivial perquisites spring ,
Why , even death stood still ,
But to an end it comes , all right ,
How urchins , flushed at day 's decline
" a scrap of paper framed for man and wife
HHoliest memories with it bring .
To find the precious morning hours were lost .
L rose the spring , and all the forest
And set to work millions of spinning worms ,
And here the poet finds his favoring muse .
Ah , quick her tears are springing ,
Which opened at once for music and for snuff ,
Would feel their element , and their chill streams
Some saw a dragon stealing up the light ,
He set his face to the darkness , and fled .
His woodland pastures waving , he sought the stream ,
Thus in your books the record shall be laid ,
True love , long sought and found at last ,
Shall rise a commonwealth .
Where waters ' neath the waters run ,
The look of grasses sweeping through the earth ,
Such light as the music sings ,
Holds a hint of the wonderful life without ;
To make my heart fit for his holy sight ,
" kalevatar took the splinter
Approach his chariot , and his knees bend ,
To see if magic fins would work :
To hide the world with false appearances .
And true love calls for you ;
Now depart my heart . .
For talking age and whispering lovers made .
Each star of meaner merit melts away !
Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold .
A selfish inclination firmly planted ,
Love makes all wisdom seem but poorest folly ,
That heaven on him above this charge had raised ,
Than human passions yield . in every heart
Each separate coloured ray . he let it fall
 peace from this reeking sword , low let him fall
And then she paused a little and went on :
Ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run
And give them battle ! how my heart leaps up
She who sparkles while she feels ?
To mend his barn , bear baucis down ;
His shining horns flash a golden gleam ;
And eyes that taught to weep ;
In little groups from that sad concourse went ,
A shadow which the onward soul behind casts :
They canna sit for anger ,
Thy soul shall find itself alone
Dark fell ere they might reach their eager feet
This sometimes gryphon took , and whirled through air ,
And they , her smiles of love caressed ,
Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves ,
Of living valor , rolling on the foe ,
Some dream within whose heart knows no disdain
The charms of wedlock all his soul belong :
There goes a mournful ho , ho .
Take either part , sure ills attend the choice ;
A schedule of his means he briefly shows ,
This shore left them wandering o'er the sea .
Which gave benediction through the dawn ;
There another crowd followed onward .
" plague pays the printer and his debt :
His late delight , no more his care receives ;
The flower which bethlehem made bloom
Sickness may depart , and time restore him , --
Never was philter filled with such power
His jaws uplifting from their fell repast ,
The regions of unfading peace ye show ,
That brought me hence ) and with that memory
When swelling public sentiment means fight .
As any muse 's tongue could tell ,
It scratched their eyes and made them blind ,
Behind me lies naught but grief and misery ;
Locked her line and caught a man ,
The value , the delight that in thee lies ;
Have spread their boughs and verdant foliage ,
And freedom sought abroad -- and
That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart ;
Glanced with a grief beyond the saltest tear ,
Some mischief lay in its fleshy part .
He sitteth there in silence , worn and wasted
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made ! "
Though joy 's right hard to grasp ,
In comes the playmate that never was seen .
To put the foe in forefront of the fight .
A sum that lifts them from despair ;
Beneath his conduct bounds the phrygian shores .
Nothing that moves to set the vision aching ,
The parapet was spread .
L take warning to the world , that i am fled
Are for the church 's peace to rest retired ;
And in sweet singing would the evening go .
" some compensation find , that the time pass not
But when the pleasant summer comes ,
What wealth historic might your words impart !
Now at last i have found to move house .
And the fig and the sycamore rise green ,
" descending hence unto the lowest powers ,
Slayer of madhu ! further , let me know
The delicate shells lay on the shore ;
A greater shadow falls : and in this shadow
The fate of a nation was riding that night ;
Where life goes on at such a petty pace ;
It lets us wander ; wander earth around ,
With drifting perfume , that reflects
Shall , in the vengeance it dispenseth , find
For youth goes over , the joys that fly ,
Even thy memory sinks into forgetting ,
But who recalls the tears she shed ,
Keep their old peace , and stay our wars .
Janitor take heart of grace ,
Lies present her case , and will conclude the fray
The flowers must lie buried in darkness
On every conscience ; laws which none shall finde
With their fists they burst asunder
Cloud and wind may pass and veer :
A fortitude that trembles to crawl .
May gain these fields by fast belief ,
That upon my pulses play :
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
If the dark face of slavery on you turns ,
To howl and chafe amid the bending trees ,
When fated hands lay garlands on its base .
He but to end their strife and quarrel came .
A womb that waits for birth ,
The present consumes all the time they can keep .
That all my sense in ravishment was lost .
Still north , until he reached a stretching wall
Has grown quiet in the night ;
Becomes not poison that doth burn and kill ;
Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers ,
And the moon stands still and listens
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross ;
And proselytes to restore autocracy .
Where proud ambition seldom shined ;
And to industry is given .
It banishes with pain or fear :
If such unhappy days should come ,
And the travail of her that bore ,
Every incident which rises in the progress of the controversy
Love owns her with his golden sway --
The way life went in the world above ,
Darkness of age has settled on your face :
And wage their war : the race elect
The waters shake with fear ;
A soul has passed .s
" he shakes his serpent tongue that sings ,
I fear we 'll come to harm . "
When silvery locks no more around his temples twined ,
That lies forever in the light ;
And her thoughts ran on as follow :
For fear the path should go astray
A warmer heart than clay can feel ?
Another story on the rock imposed ;
The dona had left her weeping ,
Peace will come on us , discord will cease ;
Yet all that is lost shall be mended ,
A little while a little space lies bright .
Expert to find anew the arms of faith ,
In these years ! yet , i see ,
An easy compensation seem to find .
Almost since man from paradise was driven ;
To ease the hardships of the labouring poor ;
To feel i loved her all the more !
L make an end of thy deception ,
For many a laugh rang through the vale ;
The little fate bestows they give as soon ;
" if she be made of white
One only prayer i dare to make ,
The rest is as the winds that blow .
The blended sweets to make th ' immortal sense .
Jolt given by a flemish musket-ball ,
That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
And lift up each soul from its grave .
Eternal truth proclaims ;
Jealousy , upon this , broke up the play ,
Althaea ’s hate the unhappy warrior bore ,
Sorrow he follow 'd from his place of rest ,
Our genial craft , together bound
Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes .
Then it made a star !
Was with such nervous tension wound ,
` he hath caught a ghost in flight .
Jawed the deep reverence , taught of old ,
Soul , take thine ease , let sorrow cease ,
To find her heart 's delighted glorying
Who curse the hand that gave you bread ,
DeWinged on a flight she could not follow ,
They partly know , and are made glad thereby .
Nor oars to guide the immeasurable way .
To tumult every bosom wrought .
And he spoke the words which follow :
Some word to keep thy memory gentle there ; --
He fills with joy his sad heart .
Had borne your sorrows in the days
And none may with my bliss compare . ”
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
And manly thoughts subdued by manly age ,
But follow god , be meek and wise ;
The age comes on , that future age of gold
That this sorrow may escape thee ,
That paves kings ' palaces , to show
To meet by thrust of spear that terrible host
His soul in that sweet hour was filled .
Reserving , human left from human free .
To sanctify the nature , -- these things make
Macerate shows how trivial the myriad things
Disdain just plagues baby youth ;
Nor take a verbal penance , but with haste
It sprung from truth alone , the truth we live
Of the great curse , which trails in every beam
A lamp to guide me through the darkness ; and
His fixed decree can change or change .
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn 'd .
And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight !
To waste the loveliness that time could give ,
Au odor volcanic , that rather spoils it ,
As though death 's veil already had been cast
Then soon from town and city numbers grew ,
You and i have found our lips can meet .
And clattering and battering and shattering ;
A welcome they give to the pilgrim ,
The spring had risen from wood and wold
Was with you in the temple , ye stood forth
A fountain 's there which never will run dry :
Her caged heart cried and shook .
The ghastly dun shall worry his sleep ,
Nor spend its hours in idleness or play .
The noted sea shall keep his name with me ,
Not by such grief as this are led
They opened up to their desire ,
There beneath the dewy hillside sleep the noblest
Recalls the deadly obloquy he made
We lift our eyes to heaven and say :
We shall take them as lightly as girls
Can wander o'er nature 's charms till now .
Baby , too , must go to sleep !
To lay out fortune 's gifts ; and niccolo
The damsel ’s breast with fury swelled :
To house the profit that arrives ;
Of suff ' ring taught me patience .
And brought the tidings in .
Who laid poor claims upon thee , perfect lord ;
It played inaudible melodies ,
A wildwood blossom lay ,
A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased .
Then , as his lips with fury burned ,
Her lips can form the tenderest words
And wits take lodgings in the sound of bow ;
When buried lay her whiter brows ,
Wine that turns to song our sorrows ;
Happy are these who follow imagination :
The valley spread its feast of roses ;
Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark ,
" thereupon the bird made answer ,
But , though it comes as a puff ,
At this last hour , the church may yet ascend
After the hour has struck , to close again .
Under stagnant roofs that fall .
And found them feasting , and all things the same
To heal the sorrow that should have died ,
The sun that fills their grave so lightly ;
Its loss and loneliness , and took my way .
Of leafless trees and drifting snows ,
The stage that twixt you stands .
There in her fatal beauty lies the queen
To cast upon his face her pitying eyes .
Except of sighs , that made th ' eternal air
On which king charles his yoke had nearly broken .
The locust follows on his musical wing ,
Before us here the bread of life is laid ,
Whose faint beat break along dim aisles ,
These to their softened hearts should bring
The new years come , the old years go ,
Of these the greater portion served to guide
Told what reward he hoped should ease his pain ,
I read its eyes , and it became hatred --
Let me catch your breathing .
Hence , his warm lay with softest sweetness bound !
For in it naught but love i find ,
Where the first napoleon lay
Quicker than thought its dire resolves are wrought ,
Of a love that knew too well ?
In lonely rooms , hid from public sight ;
That those were blossoms which he made for snows .
The jury signed the verdict and sent
First there came a gentle wind blowing ;
To mingled with what complacency he creeps ,
In wine he makes my senses feel ,
Beneath the rest it shines divinely bright ,
With his bloody crest erected ,
Guided to universal knowledge -- see ,
Little brown baby of mine , go to rest .
And might gain a peaceful dwelling .
Where in childhood , oft we strayed ;
And there came from the depths of my spirit
Their hurrying wings the shelter gave ;
May bring to the lone heart relief ?
No sin his stainless name can stain ;
Since it was made it had undergone change .
And words fell soft as willow-buds ,
He made use of as a carpet
Facing the silence -- chilling the prospect
Till at his second bidding darkness fled ,
The liquor taking , they to dancing went ,
What wrongs are borne , what deeds are done
Through their blood , and fill their souls ,
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
And invite the greeks to visit greece again .
The voices of men and women left it lonely .
Then the good lord gave certain fervid hearts ,
There lay the powers in awful synod placed ;
Past they trace with their measured tread ,
Assail it , but those talons hold in dread ,
Love took my life and took it
The realms of sweet perdition lay ,
Sorrow always comes . .
As raised her sweet eyes to the light ,
And thus you see it strangely set
The eagles floated , struggling with the wind .
So much of sunshine with him that i share ,
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
And issuing flame of spirit , giving light ,
They plunged again into the wondrous torrent ,
The hours sunk slow to twilight gray ,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses ?
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ;
That life might pierce out of arcady
My soul has set its tent of clay
Received since they were made salvation to embrace .
Quick went my breath and quick my heart ,
Will man find hope on yonder coast ?
That casts its shade on every side .
