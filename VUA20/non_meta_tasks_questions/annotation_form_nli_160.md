For example Roe ( 1952 ) , Eiduson ( 1962 ) and McClelland ( 1962 ) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood , **perhaps** suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances , so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships .

If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre 's project in the Critique , the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and **historical** necessity with the individualism of Sartre 's earlier work , that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one 's own freedom : how to relocate human practice within historical determinism , to reconcile the individual with the social , the idea of agency with that of necessity , or freedom with history ?
